1
00:00:36,167 --> 00:00:38,476
Where is it?.

2
00:00:41,167 --> 00:00:42,566
There.

3
00:00:52,247 --> 00:00:55,683
Where is it?. Where is it?.

4
00:00:59,367 --> 00:01:01,039
Oh, where is it?.

5
00:01:02,727 --> 00:01:04,319
No.

6
00:01:05,727 --> 00:01:07,763
I had it yesterday.

7
00:01:07,927 --> 00:01:11,476
What...? Oh, damned secretaries.

8
00:01:11,647 --> 00:01:13,638
No system. None at all

9
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:17,243
They just shove it anywhere.
What do they care?

10
00:01:17,407 --> 00:01:19,762
It's just another piece of paper
to them.

11
00:01:24,567 --> 00:01:27,035
I'm sure I had it yesterday.

12
00:01:29,007 --> 00:01:32,886
Yes, she wrote him a letter
after Gaius died.

13
00:01:33,967 --> 00:01:38,040
What was it?.
"The answer, I'm afraid, is no."

14
00:01:38,767 --> 00:01:40,598
Yes, that was it.

15
00:01:47,727 --> 00:01:51,003
"My dear Tiberius,
the answer, I'm afraid, is no."

16
00:01:51,167 --> 00:01:55,080
This is the one! Yes! Yes! Yes!
This is it.

17
00:01:55,807 --> 00:01:59,925
"My dear Tiberius,
the answer, I'm afraid, is no,

18
00:02:00,087 --> 00:02:01,918
"which is what I expected.

19
00:02:02,087 --> 00:02:05,204
"Augustus refuses to allow you
to return to Rome...

20
00:02:05,367 --> 00:02:07,722
(LIVIA) "Refuses even to discuss it

21
00:02:07,887 --> 00:02:11,926
"Despite the sudden and unexplained
death of his beloved Gaius,

22
00:02:12,087 --> 00:02:14,123
"and despite my pleading with him,

23
00:02:14,287 --> 00:02:16,881
"he is adamant that you
will stay where you are.

24
00:02:17,047 --> 00:02:21,086
"He has, of course never forgiven
you for what you did to Julia

25
00:02:21,247 --> 00:02:23,442
"and frankly I am not surprised."

26
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:29,963
- Well?.
- Hmm?

27
00:02:30,127 --> 00:02:34,040
Oh, it's very promising, Excellency,
very promising indeed.

28
00:02:34,207 --> 00:02:36,402
You've been saying that for years.

29
00:02:36,567 --> 00:02:39,718
Find some disasters,
then my life might get better.

30
00:02:39,887 --> 00:02:43,926
It has, Excellency. The planets are
in a most favourable conjunction.

31
00:02:45,447 --> 00:02:50,840
I'm sure that the letter from Rome
contained good news. Am I not right?.

32
00:02:51,007 --> 00:02:53,680
You might have guessed that
from my mother.

33
00:02:53,847 --> 00:02:57,476
Excellency, your mother is not
the most scrutable of women.

34
00:02:57,647 --> 00:03:00,798
One may read her letters,
but never her face.

35
00:03:00,967 --> 00:03:04,323
I'd stake my life there was
some good news in that letter.

36
00:03:04,487 --> 00:03:07,126
Come, my calculations prove it.

37
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:11,280
I'm to stay here and rot
if it has anything to do with Augustus.

38
00:03:11,447 --> 00:03:15,440
But there's more.
I'm sure there must be more.

39
00:03:17,247 --> 00:03:20,125
She promises now
to work for my return.

40
00:03:20,287 --> 00:03:25,122
Excellent! I knew it. It's all here.
The chart doesn't lie.

41
00:03:27,247 --> 00:03:31,638
But it counsels patience too.
Nothing will happen overnight.

42
00:03:31,807 --> 00:03:34,116
What else did you learn in Rome?

43
00:03:34,287 --> 00:03:37,438
Augustus has taken
the death of Gaius very hard.

44
00:03:37,647 --> 00:03:40,207
Is there more news
about how he died?

45
00:03:40,367 --> 00:03:44,918
It's mysterious. The body was burned
before an autopsy was ordered.

46
00:03:45,087 --> 00:03:49,638
When you die in the East, they don't
keep you hanging about long.

47
00:03:50,927 --> 00:03:55,603
I shan't shed any tears for him.
What else did you learn?

48
00:03:55,767 --> 00:04:00,522
Augustus intends to appoint your
other stepson to command in Spain.

49
00:04:00,687 --> 00:04:02,006
Lucius?

50
00:04:03,807 --> 00:04:06,241
He couldn't fight his way
out of a harem!

51
00:04:08,527 --> 00:04:10,119
What else?

52
00:04:10,287 --> 00:04:14,883
Your wife's behaviour is a scandal
known to all except her father.

53
00:04:15,047 --> 00:04:17,607
Suppose you finish that horoscope.

54
00:04:17,767 --> 00:04:19,803
Of course, Excellency.

55
00:04:25,247 --> 00:04:27,363
Is there anything to drink?

56
00:04:27,527 --> 00:04:31,998
My mouth is quite dry.
It's such a long climb up this hill

57
00:04:32,167 --> 00:04:37,639
It'll be a lot shorter going down
if I don't like that chart of yours.

58
00:04:41,367 --> 00:04:45,758
Why do they all hate me so?
What have I done to them?

59
00:04:48,447 --> 00:04:50,677
You could stay longer.
What's the hurry?.

60
00:04:50,847 --> 00:04:54,044
- No hurry, really.
- Rome is like a sewer in summer.

61
00:04:54,207 --> 00:04:58,917
I wasn't going back to Rome. I was
going to take the children to Ostia.

62
00:04:59,087 --> 00:05:03,558
What for?. The see is the sea.
You might as well stay here.

63
00:05:03,727 --> 00:05:07,766
Well. I thought perhaps you might
like to be on your own for a while.

64
00:05:07,927 --> 00:05:11,203
When have I ever wanted
to be on my own?

65
00:05:11,367 --> 00:05:13,642
Well. that's what I meant, really.

66
00:05:13,807 --> 00:05:16,367
Oh! No, you don't put me out.

67
00:05:16,527 --> 00:05:19,758
I have to behave myself
when the children are around.

68
00:05:19,927 --> 00:05:21,963
Well. up to a point.

69
00:05:22,127 --> 00:05:27,485
You're always sewing or weaving.
Why don't you let the slaves do it?.

70
00:05:27,647 --> 00:05:30,798
- They never do things properly.
- That's quite true.

71
00:05:30,967 --> 00:05:34,676
They don't want to work and they eat you
out of house and home.

72
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:38,442
It's hard to buy good slaves.
You must be a good judge of character.

73
00:05:38,607 --> 00:05:41,997
- Do you pick your own?
- Yes, of course. Don't you?

74
00:05:42,167 --> 00:05:45,716
I did when I lived with Tiberius.
I felt I ought to.

75
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:48,481
You know me.
I was all right with the girls,

76
00:05:48,647 --> 00:05:53,163
but when it came to the male slaves
I used to pick the good-looking ones

77
00:05:53,327 --> 00:05:55,443
and ended up doing the work myself!

78
00:05:55,607 --> 00:05:57,325
Julia, how could you?

79
00:05:57,487 --> 00:06:02,083
Living with Tiberius was not
the fulfilling experience I'd expected.

80
00:06:02,247 --> 00:06:04,442
- Mother!
- I was seldom filled.

81
00:06:04,607 --> 00:06:06,643
- What's the matter?.
- Mother!

82
00:06:06,807 --> 00:06:09,401
- What is it?.
- Look what he did.

83
00:06:09,567 --> 00:06:11,000
- Who?
- Germanicus.

84
00:06:11,167 --> 00:06:15,285
He threw sand all over me.
It's in my face, on my hair, everywhere.

85
00:06:15,447 --> 00:06:17,483
Germanicus, how could you?

86
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:21,802
I was only teasing.
She threw it in mine.

87
00:06:23,607 --> 00:06:26,075
Oh, come on, Pina. I'm sorry.

88
00:06:26,247 --> 00:06:29,478
You did it on purpose.
I'll never speak to you again.

89
00:06:29,647 --> 00:06:33,117
Come here and let me wipe it off
and stop being so dramatic.

90
00:06:33,287 --> 00:06:34,959
Germanicus?

91
00:06:37,007 --> 00:06:39,123
You mustn't be so rough.

92
00:06:39,287 --> 00:06:41,517
I'm... I'm sorry.

93
00:06:41,687 --> 00:06:43,757
(JULIA) She's perfectly all right.

94
00:06:45,807 --> 00:06:49,482
- How's Claudius?
- He's looking for shells.

95
00:06:49,647 --> 00:06:52,719
Make sure the slaves watch him
and don't leave him out.

96
00:06:52,887 --> 00:06:55,481
We won't. Come on, Pina. I'm sorry.

97
00:06:55,647 --> 00:07:00,846
Don't be too long down there!
It's time you came in out of the sun!

98
00:07:04,127 --> 00:07:06,243
They’ll be getting married soon.

99
00:07:09,167 --> 00:07:12,284
What worries me is who's going
to marry Claudius,

100
00:07:12,447 --> 00:07:15,439
with his foot and his stammer.

101
00:07:15,607 --> 00:07:17,518
There's always somebody.

102
00:07:18,287 --> 00:07:22,326
To tell you the truth, I find it
very hard to be affectionate to him.

103
00:07:22,487 --> 00:07:28,323
I ought to love him more
because of his afflictions, but I don't.

104
00:07:28,487 --> 00:07:31,285
- I think he's sweet.
- You're not his mother.

105
00:07:31,447 --> 00:07:34,439
It's not easy living with a child
who's so stupid.

106
00:07:34,607 --> 00:07:38,236
Everything you tell him you have
to repeat half a dozen times.

107
00:07:38,407 --> 00:07:41,877
What Drusus would have made of him,
I don't know.

108
00:07:42,047 --> 00:07:46,199
Ah, Drusus. You had something
wonderful there, my dear.

109
00:07:47,447 --> 00:07:51,156
Tell me, did you never wonder
about his death?

110
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:54,446
I mean, did it never
strike you as odd

111
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:57,963
that Livia's personal physician
was looking after him?

112
00:07:58,127 --> 00:08:00,482
You said something like that before.

113
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:05,277
I said that I thought that Livia had
a hand in it, and I still think so.

114
00:08:05,447 --> 00:08:08,120
- Tiberius thought so.
- I can't believe that.

115
00:08:08,967 --> 00:08:11,925
People say that Tiberius
didn't mind being banished

116
00:08:12,087 --> 00:08:15,762
because he was glad to get away
from me. But that wasn't it.

117
00:08:15,927 --> 00:08:19,044
I think he was pleased to get away
from his mother.

118
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:22,404
She used to invite him to dinner
too often!

119
00:08:22,567 --> 00:08:24,159
Julia, don't joke.

120
00:08:24,327 --> 00:08:25,726
I'm not!

121
00:08:25,887 --> 00:08:29,721
I've seen his face often enough
when she's poured wine for him.

122
00:08:29,887 --> 00:08:32,720
I don't dine there happily myself.

123
00:08:35,687 --> 00:08:37,837
You've upset me, you really have.

124
00:08:38,007 --> 00:08:41,443
It's terrible to accuse someone
of poisoning without proof.

125
00:08:41,607 --> 00:08:45,077
She accuses me of all sorts
of things without proof!

126
00:08:45,247 --> 00:08:47,761
Make sure she doesn't get any, then.

127
00:08:49,207 --> 00:08:51,641
- Are you leaving, Lucius?
- Yes, Mother.

128
00:08:51,807 --> 00:08:53,798
We'll be in Rome before nightfall

129
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:57,118
It's been so pleasant here.
I love your house.

130
00:08:57,287 --> 00:09:01,678
You must come again. I've got
a little present for you in my study.

131
00:09:01,847 --> 00:09:04,680
A memento of your visit.
We shan't be long.

132
00:09:04,847 --> 00:09:06,565
Nothing for me, Mother?.

133
00:09:06,727 --> 00:09:09,287
You don't deserve anything
leaving so soon!

134
00:09:11,607 --> 00:09:14,405
- When are you leaving for Spain?
- In a few months.

135
00:09:14,567 --> 00:09:17,161
Augustus must have
great confidence in you.

136
00:09:17,327 --> 00:09:19,477
Yes. Yes, I think so.

137
00:09:23,487 --> 00:09:25,045
Deserter.

138
00:09:28,087 --> 00:09:30,203
I shall be here all summer.

139
00:09:32,167 --> 00:09:34,317
Oh, I could eat you.

140
00:09:35,967 --> 00:09:39,198
- Here comes your brother.
- Postumus. I'm leaving.

141
00:09:40,007 --> 00:09:42,396
What's wrong?
Have you lost something?

142
00:09:42,567 --> 00:09:44,956
No. Are you going back to Rome?

143
00:09:45,127 --> 00:09:46,879
- Yes.
- May I come with you?

144
00:09:47,047 --> 00:09:49,845
You can ask Mother,
but I'm sure she'll say no.

145
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:51,998
- What's the matter?.
- Nothing.

146
00:09:52,167 --> 00:09:55,000
- He's had a quarrel with Livilla.
- Oh, shut up.

147
00:09:55,167 --> 00:09:58,603
I don't know why you quarrel
so much. Can't you be nice?

148
00:09:58,767 --> 00:10:02,203
Look who's called to visit us.
Gnaeus Domitius.

149
00:10:04,407 --> 00:10:06,523
I was on my way to Formiae.

150
00:10:07,087 --> 00:10:09,885
I felt I must call upon you, Lady.

151
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:12,083
Do you know my son, Lucius?

152
00:10:12,927 --> 00:10:14,838
An honour, sir.

153
00:10:15,007 --> 00:10:18,682
I took the auspices for your brother
before he left for Syria.

154
00:10:18,847 --> 00:10:20,838
They were most favourable.

155
00:10:21,007 --> 00:10:23,567
I've never seen the liver of a ewe
so clear.

156
00:10:23,727 --> 00:10:25,957
One could almost see through it.

157
00:10:26,127 --> 00:10:29,199
His death is inexplicable to me.

158
00:10:29,367 --> 00:10:32,564
And to us all
My youngest, Postumus.

159
00:10:34,407 --> 00:10:37,479
- We must go, Mother.
- Yes. Take care on the journey.

160
00:10:37,647 --> 00:10:41,640
- May I go with them, Mother?.
- Whatever for?. Certainly not.

161
00:10:42,207 --> 00:10:43,765
Goodbye, Antonia.

162
00:10:46,007 --> 00:10:48,999
- Go and make it up with Livilla.
- Oh, shut up.

163
00:10:49,167 --> 00:10:50,520
Sir.

164
00:10:50,847 --> 00:10:52,838
Come, Plautius, we'll make a start.

165
00:10:53,767 --> 00:10:56,759
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

166
00:11:00,767 --> 00:11:03,406
Here come the children.
Let's go into the house.

167
00:11:03,567 --> 00:11:06,923
It sounds as if they’ve been
quarrelling.

168
00:11:07,087 --> 00:11:10,557
Eagles! They’re fighting!
Postumus, look at the eagles!

169
00:11:10,727 --> 00:11:12,922
What are they fighting for?.

170
00:11:13,087 --> 00:11:16,921
One of them's got something!
See, in its claws there.

171
00:11:17,087 --> 00:11:19,282
(SCREECHING OVERHEAD)

172
00:11:19,447 --> 00:11:22,245
Mother, Mother,
the eagles are fighting!

173
00:11:24,207 --> 00:11:25,845
Look out!

174
00:11:28,407 --> 00:11:30,318
What is it, Claudius?

175
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:34,285
It's a wolf cub.

176
00:11:34,447 --> 00:11:37,405
Mother, it dropped
right from its claws.

177
00:11:37,567 --> 00:11:39,285
Let me have him!

178
00:11:39,447 --> 00:11:42,325
Leave it be! It fell to Claudius,
leave it be!

179
00:11:42,487 --> 00:11:46,275
Look at the blood.
Ye Gods, what does it mean?

180
00:11:47,127 --> 00:11:49,118
Domitius, tell us what it means.

181
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:54,403
- Lady, I...
- You know what it means, I can see.

182
00:11:54,567 --> 00:11:56,558
Tell us, I beg you.

183
00:11:57,087 --> 00:12:00,079
- Children, go into the house.
- No! Let them stay.

184
00:12:00,247 --> 00:12:02,283
The sign was given to you all.

185
00:12:02,447 --> 00:12:06,235
and given now, perhaps,
because I am here to read it.

186
00:12:07,087 --> 00:12:09,078
But they must be sworn to secrecy.

187
00:12:09,247 --> 00:12:11,841
Who are the gods
that watch over this house?

188
00:12:12,007 --> 00:12:13,679
Jupiter and Mars.

189
00:12:13,847 --> 00:12:18,443
Then do you swear, all of you,
by these your gods...

190
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:23,286
that no word of what you are about
to hear shall ever pass your lips?

191
00:12:23,447 --> 00:12:25,039
(ALL) Yes, we do.

192
00:12:27,527 --> 00:12:32,601
The wolf cub is Rome.
No doubt of it.

193
00:12:32,767 --> 00:12:36,237
Romulus was suckled by a wolf
as her own cub,

194
00:12:36,407 --> 00:12:39,285
and Romulus was Rome.

195
00:12:41,007 --> 00:12:43,282
And look at it.

196
00:12:43,447 --> 00:12:48,805
All torn about the nock
and shivering with fear.

197
00:12:49,687 --> 00:12:51,678
A wretched sight.

198
00:12:52,967 --> 00:12:56,403
Rome will be wretched one day.

199
00:12:59,767 --> 00:13:03,476
But he will protect it.

200
00:13:04,407 --> 00:13:07,558
He and no other.

201
00:13:07,727 --> 00:13:11,561
(LIVILLA LAUGHS)
Claudius as protector of Rome!

202
00:13:11,727 --> 00:13:14,082
I hope I shall be dead by then.

203
00:13:14,247 --> 00:13:17,557
Go to your room! You shall have
nothing to eat all day!

204
00:13:19,527 --> 00:13:22,041
Children, come in. Come inside.

205
00:13:27,527 --> 00:13:34,763
May I k-k-keep the cub,
please, Mother?. Please may I?

206
00:13:37,527 --> 00:13:40,087
Well. it is true? Have I heard right?.

207
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:43,282
Are you having my daughter-in-law?.

208
00:13:46,127 --> 00:13:49,005
Come, you can be frank with me.

209
00:13:50,367 --> 00:13:55,043
As a matter of fact it would be
better for you to be frank with me.

210
00:13:56,207 --> 00:13:59,119
She took a fancy to me.

211
00:13:59,727 --> 00:14:02,002
I'm sure she did.

212
00:14:02,167 --> 00:14:06,126
Well. what could I do? She is,
after all. Caesar’s daughter.

213
00:14:06,287 --> 00:14:08,357
You were wise not to refuse her.

214
00:14:09,367 --> 00:14:11,722
Would you do as much for me?

215
00:14:12,807 --> 00:14:15,719
I am, after all. Caesar’s wife.

216
00:14:30,687 --> 00:14:33,042
Quite a stud, aren't you?

217
00:14:33,207 --> 00:14:37,837
You find me utterly repulsive,
but you'd try all the same.

218
00:14:38,007 --> 00:14:41,044
I like that. I like a trier.

219
00:14:42,487 --> 00:14:44,717
You're a very beautiful woman.

220
00:14:44,887 --> 00:14:46,764
I'm an old one.

221
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:51,921
Still. that wouldn't stop you if you
thought I could do something for you.

222
00:14:52,087 --> 00:14:55,443
Well. perhaps I can.

223
00:14:58,287 --> 00:15:02,917
Yours is a noble family,
but poor, I believe.

224
00:15:03,807 --> 00:15:07,959
- They’ve been unfortunate.
- But not in you, clearly.

225
00:15:08,127 --> 00:15:11,563
No. In you I would say
they have been very fortunate.

226
00:15:11,727 --> 00:15:13,399
Come closer.

227
00:15:16,087 --> 00:15:18,885
How long have you known
my daughter-in-law?.

228
00:15:19,047 --> 00:15:22,005
Not long. A month or so.

229
00:15:22,167 --> 00:15:26,877
And did you meat her through
her son, or her son through her?.

230
00:15:27,047 --> 00:15:29,197
I was Lucius' friend first.

231
00:15:29,367 --> 00:15:32,439
I stayed at the house in Antium
for a few days.

232
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:36,441
What a lovely time you must have had.
Have you been there since?

233
00:15:36,607 --> 00:15:38,006
Yes.

234
00:15:38,167 --> 00:15:42,319
Tell me, does Lucius know
you're ploughing his mother's furrow

235
00:15:42,487 --> 00:15:44,762
with such ferocious
skill and energy.

236
00:15:47,687 --> 00:15:49,643
Well. I don't know.

237
00:15:50,847 --> 00:15:52,485
Perhaps he...

238
00:15:53,447 --> 00:15:56,245
- Perhaps he...
- Guesses?

239
00:15:57,207 --> 00:15:59,846
Well. that wouldn't be hard, would it?.

240
00:16:00,007 --> 00:16:03,079
All Rome apart from her father guesses.

241
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:07,277
How much does Lucius mean to you?

242
00:16:08,687 --> 00:16:10,598
He means more than I can say.

243
00:16:10,767 --> 00:16:13,804
Oh, not more than you can say, surely?.

244
00:16:15,047 --> 00:16:16,560
Try.

245
00:16:17,527 --> 00:16:20,166
I am his best friend.

246
00:16:24,767 --> 00:16:26,883
Lady, what do you want of me?

247
00:16:27,967 --> 00:16:30,481
I want to help you in your career.

248
00:16:31,967 --> 00:16:34,276
You'd liked to be helped,
wouldn't you?

249
00:16:34,447 --> 00:16:39,567
Yes. And what must I do in exchange?
Stop seeing the Lady Julia?

250
00:16:41,407 --> 00:16:45,446
Oh, you've a mighty high opinion
of yourself, haven't you?

251
00:16:45,607 --> 00:16:49,122
Do you imagine that I would stoop
to buying you off

252
00:16:49,287 --> 00:16:51,676
when I could swat you
like a fly if I wanted?

253
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:54,718
- I meant...
- Hold your tongue.

254
00:16:54,887 --> 00:16:57,879
I will tell you what I want
and you will provide it.

255
00:16:58,047 --> 00:17:01,357
I want a catalogue of my
daughter-in-law's activities.

256
00:17:01,527 --> 00:17:03,836
I want names, dates, places.

257
00:17:05,367 --> 00:17:08,518
Far from breaking with her,
you may encourage her.

258
00:17:09,847 --> 00:17:13,078
Well. she needs little encouragement.

259
00:17:13,247 --> 00:17:15,841
Less work for you, then, isn't it?.

260
00:17:17,207 --> 00:17:19,675
Yes, I can see the attraction.

261
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:25,686
You should go far
if you manage to keep your head.

262
00:17:27,127 --> 00:17:28,765
You may go now.

263
00:17:30,927 --> 00:17:32,519
Oh, Plautius?

264
00:17:32,687 --> 00:17:36,680
You need not, of course,
include your own name on that list...

265
00:17:38,247 --> 00:17:40,124
for the moment.

266
00:17:45,967 --> 00:17:48,435
(ALL MURMUR) Caesar.

267
00:18:03,727 --> 00:18:07,322
Praxis, look at this.
They’ve just delivered it.

268
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:12,277
It's a bust of my late adopted son,
Gaius.

269
00:18:12,447 --> 00:18:14,836
What a beautiful face, Caesar.

270
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:17,718
Such a noble brow.

271
00:18:18,527 --> 00:18:22,361
- What a tragic loss for Rome.
- Thank you, Praxis. Thank you.

272
00:18:23,767 --> 00:18:28,557
Caesar, the representatives
of the Noble Order of Knights are here.

273
00:18:28,727 --> 00:18:31,958
- Hmm?
- You asked to see them in here

274
00:18:32,127 --> 00:18:35,324
to address them on the subject
of the marriage laws.

275
00:18:35,487 --> 00:18:38,763
Oh, yes. Yes.

276
00:18:39,607 --> 00:18:41,598
I'll see them out there.

277
00:18:59,927 --> 00:19:04,159
Hay! Hay! Boy! Boy, come here!
Come! Stay with me.

278
00:19:07,607 --> 00:19:11,486
I've called you here
because I'm sick and tired...

279
00:19:12,447 --> 00:19:14,085
Look. Up, up.

280
00:19:15,727 --> 00:19:19,720
..of the constant complaints that I've
been getting from you and others

281
00:19:19,887 --> 00:19:23,084
about the severity of the laws
I've made against bachelors.

282
00:19:23,247 --> 00:19:27,604
To that I say, stop complaining
and get married!

283
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:31,123
Because your complaints
don't impress me that much.

284
00:19:31,287 --> 00:19:34,882
And who in Hades do you think
you are, Vestal Virgins?

285
00:19:35,047 --> 00:19:37,038
You make me sick, the lot of you!

286
00:19:37,847 --> 00:19:40,566
Look at that.
Do you know what that is?

287
00:19:40,727 --> 00:19:45,801
That is a child. A Roman child.
How in Hades do you think he got there?

288
00:19:45,967 --> 00:19:50,483
By a Roman man and a Roman woman
coming together in the same bed.

289
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:53,957
That is the fine product
of a proper Roman union!

290
00:19:54,127 --> 00:19:56,641
- Can't you stop that twitching?
- I ca-ca...

291
00:19:56,807 --> 00:19:58,365
Oh, never mind.

292
00:19:58,807 --> 00:20:02,163
Oh, I hear some titters.

293
00:20:03,007 --> 00:20:07,080
You can do better, can you?
You murderers of your own posterity!

294
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:11,001
Well. damn well go and do it now!
Quick as boiled asparagus!

295
00:20:11,167 --> 00:20:14,682
Or, by thunder, I'll bring in
some laws you won't like!

296
00:20:14,847 --> 00:20:17,122
And that's all
I've got to say to you!

297
00:20:20,327 --> 00:20:24,161
Don't try to get round it by getting
engaged to nine-year-old girls.

298
00:20:24,327 --> 00:20:28,206
I know that dodge. A radish
may know no Greek, but I do.

299
00:20:28,967 --> 00:20:30,844
Now, which one are you?

300
00:20:32,647 --> 00:20:34,603
- Claudius.
- Oh, yes, Drusus' boy.

301
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:37,201
Shouldn't you be at your lessons?

302
00:20:38,007 --> 00:20:41,238
Don't you like your lessons?
No. I don't like mine.

303
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:45,958
- You can't do nothing all day.
- Get back to your lessons at once.

304
00:20:46,127 --> 00:20:48,846
He's been helping me.
I used him as a model

305
00:20:49,007 --> 00:20:51,840
- A model of what?. Idiocy?.
- No, no.

306
00:20:52,527 --> 00:20:54,438
Never mind. Off you go.

307
00:20:57,087 --> 00:20:59,840
That child should have been
exposed at birth.

308
00:21:00,007 --> 00:21:02,999
- We don't do that anymore.
- More's the pity.

309
00:21:03,167 --> 00:21:07,877
He twitches, stutters and limps.
Even his mother can't stand him.

310
00:21:08,047 --> 00:21:10,242
Well. he's quite harmless.

311
00:21:10,407 --> 00:21:16,164
He gets on my nerves. He talks
to himself and irritates people.

312
00:21:16,327 --> 00:21:18,966
- I want to talk to you.
- What about?.

313
00:21:19,127 --> 00:21:20,606
Marriage.

314
00:21:20,767 --> 00:21:24,555
That's what I've been talking about.
There's not enough of it.

315
00:21:24,727 --> 00:21:28,276
Which is why the family
should set a good example.

316
00:21:29,167 --> 00:21:32,682
You remember how early Gaius
and Lucius were betrothed,

317
00:21:32,847 --> 00:21:34,678
and Tiberius too.

318
00:21:35,607 --> 00:21:39,725
- On the subject of Tiberius...
- Leave me alone on Tiberius.

319
00:21:39,887 --> 00:21:45,200
What harm would it do if he came
back to Rome as a private citizen?

320
00:21:45,367 --> 00:21:49,121
I know he's your son. Your feelings
are natural in a mother.

321
00:21:49,287 --> 00:21:52,199
But we've had this out before
and so many times.

322
00:21:52,367 --> 00:21:55,086
For what he did to Julia,
I shall never forgive him.

323
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:59,445
Perhaps the fault was not all on
one side? Perhaps he was provoked?

324
00:21:59,607 --> 00:22:01,563
No. I can't accept that.

325
00:22:01,727 --> 00:22:04,764
I know you'll say
I'm her father, she can do no wrong.

326
00:22:04,927 --> 00:22:07,885
But if she's done wrong,
let someone prove it.

327
00:22:08,047 --> 00:22:12,484
Black and white, chapter and verse,
and not sly backstairs gossip.

328
00:22:12,647 --> 00:22:15,684
Let's not talk about it again.
My mind is closed.

329
00:22:15,847 --> 00:22:17,963
Now, on the subject of marriage.

330
00:22:18,647 --> 00:22:22,401
What do you suggest?. Agrippina
and Germanicus - that's obvious.

331
00:22:22,567 --> 00:22:26,242
Yes. We should arranged
the betrothal as soon as possible.

332
00:22:26,407 --> 00:22:29,604
And Castor and Livilla too.

333
00:22:29,767 --> 00:22:33,077
Castor and Livilla? Are you sure?
I thought Postumus.

334
00:22:33,247 --> 00:22:36,239
He's a little monster
and Livilla can't stand him.

335
00:22:36,407 --> 00:22:40,639
Well. if you say so. She's a bit
of a flirt, then. She teases him a lot.

336
00:22:40,807 --> 00:22:43,844
- That's natural in a girl
- Yes, I suppose so.

337
00:22:44,007 --> 00:22:47,283
What about Claudius?
Who's going to marry Claudius?

338
00:22:47,647 --> 00:22:53,404
I'll find someone. It won't be easy,
but I'll find someone.

339
00:22:53,567 --> 00:22:56,843
Most women marry fools,
but it takes them a while to find out.

340
00:22:57,007 --> 00:22:59,999
With Claudius, it's as plain
as the nose on his face.

341
00:23:02,687 --> 00:23:05,599
(PLAYS A MELANCHOLY TUNE)

342
00:23:31,207 --> 00:23:32,879
Plautius.

343
00:23:33,047 --> 00:23:36,926
Why didn't you save me
from this beast?.

344
00:24:47,087 --> 00:24:50,966
So Father asked me to see his
own personal physician, so I did.

345
00:24:51,127 --> 00:24:54,722
Do you know what he told me?
He told me not to eat so much.

346
00:24:54,887 --> 00:24:58,641
He said if I stopped eating so much,
the palpitations would go.

347
00:24:58,807 --> 00:25:01,958
- I ask you, am I a big eater?.
- Well..

348
00:25:02,127 --> 00:25:04,766
I can't live on lettuce.
I'm not a caterpillar.

349
00:25:06,687 --> 00:25:09,565
Hello, Aunt J-J-Julia.

350
00:25:09,727 --> 00:25:13,356
Hello, dear.
Who's that you've got there?

351
00:25:13,527 --> 00:25:15,404
His name's Herod.

352
00:25:15,567 --> 00:25:20,516
His grandfather
is King of the J-J-Jews.

353
00:25:20,687 --> 00:25:22,757
Really?. And what's he doing here?

354
00:25:22,927 --> 00:25:27,478
He's been sent to be educated
in Rome and he's been put in my class.

355
00:25:27,647 --> 00:25:31,162
Well. how nice.
He's a handsome lad, isn't he?

356
00:25:31,887 --> 00:25:36,642
Do I have the honour of addressing
the wife of the great Agrippa?

357
00:25:38,407 --> 00:25:40,238
Yes, dear, you do.

358
00:25:40,407 --> 00:25:42,318
My name is Herod Agrippa.

359
00:25:42,487 --> 00:25:46,400
I was named after your illustrious
husband Marcus Agrippa.

360
00:25:46,567 --> 00:25:51,482
Really?. Well. wasn't that nice
of your father to do that?.

361
00:25:51,727 --> 00:25:55,197
No. It was my grandfather
who did that.

362
00:25:56,407 --> 00:25:57,999
It was nice of him, then.

363
00:25:58,167 --> 00:26:00,442
He's not very nice, Lady.

364
00:26:00,607 --> 00:26:04,122
He had my father executed
soon after I was born.

365
00:26:04,287 --> 00:26:06,118
Oh, dear.

366
00:26:07,127 --> 00:26:10,244
- I am sorry.
- Yes. So was my father.

367
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:13,758
This is my m-m-mother.

368
00:26:13,927 --> 00:26:15,918
The great Lady Antonia,

369
00:26:16,087 --> 00:26:19,523
daughter of Mark Antony
and wife of the noble Drusus.

370
00:26:19,687 --> 00:26:23,680
My, you do know a lot about us.

371
00:26:23,847 --> 00:26:25,644
I have studied you all

372
00:26:25,807 --> 00:26:29,117
You are all known throughout
the world. You are famous.

373
00:26:29,287 --> 00:26:33,405
Well. you may come and visit us
whenever you like.

374
00:26:33,567 --> 00:26:36,718
Have you introduced him
to Germanicus and Livilla yet?.

375
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:38,400
Not yet.

376
00:26:39,887 --> 00:26:42,685
C-ccome on, Herod.

377
00:26:44,047 --> 00:26:47,835
Thank you for receiving
a mere provincial so generously.

378
00:26:50,287 --> 00:26:54,041
What a polite boy!
And how well he speaks Latin.

379
00:26:54,647 --> 00:26:57,207
Julia, not another fig.

380
00:26:57,927 --> 00:26:59,918
Figs are good for you.

381
00:27:00,527 --> 00:27:02,438
You sound just like Lucius.

382
00:27:02,607 --> 00:27:05,280
You'll miss him
when he goes to Spain.

383
00:27:05,447 --> 00:27:09,918
Mmm. I shall miss that good-looking
friend of his even more.

384
00:27:11,807 --> 00:27:13,843
Quite a collection!

385
00:27:15,007 --> 00:27:17,726
It certainly doesn't lack variety,
does it?.

386
00:27:18,727 --> 00:27:21,525
I hope these names
will stand up to examination?

387
00:27:21,687 --> 00:27:23,996
Everything there can be verified.

388
00:27:25,247 --> 00:27:28,523
Who, for example, is Gershon?

389
00:27:29,567 --> 00:27:33,321
One of the house slaves -
from Africa.

390
00:27:33,487 --> 00:27:38,436
Scandalous. Are there
any other slaves on this list?.

391
00:27:38,607 --> 00:27:43,761
One or two. The rest are mainly
Romans of good birth and family.

392
00:27:43,927 --> 00:27:46,566
Not quite good enough, it appears.

393
00:27:50,047 --> 00:27:53,278
- You've done well
- Thank you.

394
00:27:54,087 --> 00:27:57,636
You've no qualms about betraying
your friend's mother?.

395
00:27:59,207 --> 00:28:03,917
- In matters of state, I...
- Oh, you do learn fast, don't you?

396
00:28:05,207 --> 00:28:08,563
And what about your friend,
as distinct from his mother?.

397
00:28:12,367 --> 00:28:14,562
You are ambitious.

398
00:28:16,687 --> 00:28:20,760
- When you tell Caesar Augustus...
- Oh, I shan't tell him.

399
00:28:20,927 --> 00:28:23,646
He wouldn't appreciate it
coming from me.

400
00:28:23,807 --> 00:28:27,561
You see, he would question,
in his mind, my motives.

401
00:28:27,727 --> 00:28:30,321
No, no. I must find someone else
to do that.

402
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:33,283
But your name won't be mentioned.

403
00:28:37,407 --> 00:28:40,285
I may have another
little assignment for you.

404
00:28:40,447 --> 00:28:42,563
If I can be of service.

405
00:28:42,727 --> 00:28:45,366
It may not be quite so enjoyable.

406
00:28:45,527 --> 00:28:49,679
One can't always combine business
with pleasure.

407
00:28:51,247 --> 00:28:52,566
No.

408
00:28:52,727 --> 00:28:56,402
And, usually, it's better not to.

409
00:28:59,087 --> 00:29:00,406
You may go now.

410
00:29:03,967 --> 00:29:05,798
You knew about it!

411
00:29:06,727 --> 00:29:10,879
You knew all along,
but you did nothing. Nothing!

412
00:29:11,047 --> 00:29:13,845
- What could I do?
- You could have gone to Augustus.

413
00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:18,804
I thought he knew but had just
closed his ayes to it.

414
00:29:18,967 --> 00:29:21,117
Shame on you!

415
00:29:23,127 --> 00:29:28,201
Shame you should think him such a man
when he thinks so highly of you!

416
00:29:28,367 --> 00:29:34,681
- Would you have me inform on my mother?. !
- You could have come to me! To me!

417
00:29:34,847 --> 00:29:37,725
Do you think I'd have stood by
and done nothing?

418
00:29:37,887 --> 00:29:42,802
I'd have tried to save her.
Now it's too late to save either of you.

419
00:29:46,127 --> 00:29:47,640
Gods.

420
00:29:52,007 --> 00:29:55,238
- I should have told you.
- You should have told him.

421
00:29:56,247 --> 00:29:59,205
It's not for that alone
that he'll condemn you.

422
00:29:59,367 --> 00:30:03,121
That you did nothing is bad enough,
but you did more.

423
00:30:03,287 --> 00:30:07,883
- You aided and abetted...
- No! No.

424
00:30:08,047 --> 00:30:10,720
You acted as her pimp
and her procurer!

425
00:30:10,887 --> 00:30:12,798
- That's not true!
- Liar!

426
00:30:12,967 --> 00:30:17,199
You introduced your friend Plautius
to her for that purpose.

427
00:30:17,367 --> 00:30:18,720
Plautius?

428
00:30:18,887 --> 00:30:20,957
Do you deny he has been her lover?.

429
00:30:21,687 --> 00:30:26,158
Do you deny he was the organiser
of her orgies in Antium and in Rome?

430
00:30:26,327 --> 00:30:29,364
He's not the first of your friends
to wind up in her bed!

431
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:33,566
- It may look that way to you...
- How will it look to Augustus?

432
00:30:33,727 --> 00:30:39,643
Like mother, like son -
that's how it will look. Oh!

433
00:30:40,607 --> 00:30:43,326
What a blow this will be to him.

434
00:30:44,767 --> 00:30:48,726
Not enough that his daughter is
revealed as the town prostitute,

435
00:30:48,887 --> 00:30:53,244
but that her son, whom he groomed
for the highest office,

436
00:30:53,407 --> 00:30:56,444
has connived with her,
encouraged her

437
00:30:56,607 --> 00:30:59,883
and even supplied her with lovers.

438
00:31:07,527 --> 00:31:09,563
- What can I do?
- Nothing!

439
00:31:09,727 --> 00:31:11,718
There's nothing you can do.

440
00:31:11,887 --> 00:31:17,166
You and your mother have destroyed
the two dearest things in his life.

441
00:31:18,727 --> 00:31:21,036
And to think that I, his wife,

442
00:31:21,207 --> 00:31:25,200
should have to expose the corruption
in his own family.

443
00:31:28,647 --> 00:31:30,956
Let me do it! Please!

444
00:31:31,127 --> 00:31:34,085
Give me this once chance
to make good.

445
00:31:35,767 --> 00:31:37,598
- You?
- Please.

446
00:31:37,767 --> 00:31:40,076
My sin was one of omission,
nothing else.

447
00:31:40,247 --> 00:31:44,206
Give me this chance to redeem myself.
Give me the list.

448
00:31:57,167 --> 00:32:00,557
Very well Let it be your doing
and not mine.

449
00:32:45,447 --> 00:32:49,599
You, Aelius Sextus Balbas.

450
00:32:50,687 --> 00:32:53,997
Is it true?
Have you slept with my daughter?.

451
00:32:56,247 --> 00:32:58,920
- Caesar, I...
- Answer the question.

452
00:33:00,967 --> 00:33:02,764
Yes, Caesar.

453
00:33:04,847 --> 00:33:08,635
And you, Marcus Volunsius Saturnius?

454
00:33:09,727 --> 00:33:11,797
Have you slept with my daughter?.

455
00:33:13,887 --> 00:33:16,401
- Caesar...
- Just answer the question.

456
00:33:20,527 --> 00:33:22,040
Yes, Caesar.

457
00:33:24,007 --> 00:33:26,396
And you? Have you?

458
00:33:28,367 --> 00:33:32,246
And you, Publius Norbanus Flaccus?

459
00:33:34,167 --> 00:33:35,805
Once, Caesar.

460
00:33:36,367 --> 00:33:40,042
Ah, only once? That's all?.

461
00:33:47,727 --> 00:33:49,683
Not slept, Caesar.

462
00:33:50,887 --> 00:33:54,641
Not slept?. You mean it happened
standing up, perhaps?

463
00:33:54,807 --> 00:33:58,436
Or in the street or on a bench?
Not slept?.

464
00:34:28,207 --> 00:34:33,759
(YELLS) Is there anyone in Rome
who has not slept with my daughter?. !

465
00:34:35,007 --> 00:34:38,920
Take them out! I'll decide
what to do with them later!

466
00:34:44,687 --> 00:34:47,406
- Grandfather...
- No, no! I'm all right.

467
00:34:47,567 --> 00:34:50,206
This must have been hard for you.
Terrible.

468
00:34:50,367 --> 00:34:53,757
It's a wonderful thing you've done.
I'm proud of you.

469
00:35:13,767 --> 00:35:17,043
I shall banish her!
Banish her for life.

470
00:35:17,727 --> 00:35:20,480
Don't tell me where she's gone
or mention her name.

471
00:35:20,647 --> 00:35:23,844
But let her...!
Let her be all alone.

472
00:35:24,007 --> 00:35:28,398
All alone until she dies!
She's not fit for human company!

473
00:35:28,567 --> 00:35:31,365
(SCREAMING) Father!

474
00:35:32,127 --> 00:35:35,563
Father!

475
00:35:35,727 --> 00:35:37,365
Please!

476
00:35:37,527 --> 00:35:39,563
Please let me in!

477
00:35:39,727 --> 00:35:42,082
Let me talk to you!

478
00:35:42,247 --> 00:35:44,681
Let me explain!

479
00:35:47,647 --> 00:35:49,205
Father?.

480
00:35:50,887 --> 00:35:52,718
Father!

481
00:35:52,887 --> 00:35:56,277
Please! Please don't send me away!

482
00:35:56,447 --> 00:36:00,486
Please, please,
please don't send me away!

483
00:36:00,647 --> 00:36:02,717
I couldn't bear it!

484
00:36:02,887 --> 00:36:05,447
I couldn't bear it!

485
00:36:06,287 --> 00:36:09,199
Not alone. Please!

486
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:12,916
Plea-ea-ease!

487
00:36:17,007 --> 00:36:18,725
Please!

488
00:36:18,887 --> 00:36:21,640
Please, Father!

489
00:36:23,407 --> 00:36:25,921
Please let me talk to you!

490
00:36:31,927 --> 00:36:34,077
Father, please!

491
00:36:34,887 --> 00:36:36,878
Please.

492
00:36:37,047 --> 00:36:39,197
Give me another chance.

493
00:36:40,167 --> 00:36:41,885
Please.

494
00:36:42,047 --> 00:36:44,686
(SHE SOBS)

495
00:36:44,847 --> 00:36:47,315
Please.

496
00:36:58,847 --> 00:37:00,838
This is your doing, isn't it?.

497
00:37:01,807 --> 00:37:03,798
Don't think I don't know.

498
00:37:03,967 --> 00:37:06,686
You think you're very clever.

499
00:37:07,487 --> 00:37:11,480
You think that by discrediting me,
he'll bring your son back.

500
00:37:11,647 --> 00:37:13,797
You're so transparent.

501
00:37:15,127 --> 00:37:18,915
You want that precious son of yours
to follow him when he dies

502
00:37:19,087 --> 00:37:21,078
so you can come into your own.

503
00:37:21,247 --> 00:37:25,843
But I have two sons,
and they both come before yours.

504
00:37:27,167 --> 00:37:29,681
So make your mind up to it, Livia.

505
00:37:29,847 --> 00:37:34,682
When my father dies,
you won't be wanted anymore.

506
00:37:36,887 --> 00:37:42,166
So take my advice and climb
on the funeral pyre with him!

507
00:37:51,287 --> 00:37:53,960
(SHE TRIES DOOR HANDLE)

508
00:38:03,567 --> 00:38:07,765
So you've come out of your room
at last.

509
00:38:19,847 --> 00:38:21,838
I'm cursed, Livia.

510
00:38:24,127 --> 00:38:26,004
I'm cursed.

511
00:38:26,167 --> 00:38:28,203
First Gaius, then this.

512
00:38:29,447 --> 00:38:31,722
What have I done to deserve this?

513
00:38:31,887 --> 00:38:33,798
Yes.

514
00:38:35,247 --> 00:38:38,796
It's a hard thing
to see a child banished.

515
00:38:39,687 --> 00:38:41,598
Don't I know that?.

516
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:48,962
But how much harder when one knows
the banishment is undeserved?

517
00:38:49,127 --> 00:38:55,043
Have you thought of that?. Have you
thought how I have felt these years?

518
00:39:03,807 --> 00:39:08,722
Yes. You must let my son come home.

519
00:39:09,687 --> 00:39:13,123
With Lucius in Spain,
we need him here in Rome.

520
00:39:13,287 --> 00:39:19,123
And besides, can't you see now
what has been plain to me for years?

521
00:39:19,287 --> 00:39:23,200
That it was her wickedness
that drove him away.

522
00:39:27,727 --> 00:39:30,321
I'll never bring him back - never!

523
00:39:30,487 --> 00:39:33,797
He drove her to it!
He set her on that road.

524
00:39:33,967 --> 00:39:38,040
This wouldn't have happened
but for him! I'll never bring him back!

525
00:39:38,207 --> 00:39:40,243
He can stay there and rot!

526
00:40:02,047 --> 00:40:04,641
Excellency, there's a ship in the harbour.

527
00:40:04,807 --> 00:40:06,286
I know.

528
00:40:06,447 --> 00:40:09,519
I'm sure it will bring
important letters for you.

529
00:40:09,687 --> 00:40:11,996
I thought they might have arrived.

530
00:40:12,167 --> 00:40:14,123
No, Thrasyllus, nothing has arrived.

531
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:17,996
What do you see in your horoscope?
It must be good news.

532
00:40:18,167 --> 00:40:21,239
I'm not looking at mine.
I'm looking at yours.

533
00:40:21,407 --> 00:40:24,444
At mine? You must be joking.

534
00:40:24,607 --> 00:40:28,600
If there's good news, you'll find it
in your horoscope, not mine.

535
00:40:28,767 --> 00:40:33,761
Mine has been so indecisive lately,
I thought I'd examine yours.

536
00:40:33,927 --> 00:40:37,397
But why?. What could that
possibly tell you?

537
00:40:38,127 --> 00:40:43,121
I decided today that if nothing
pleasing came off that boat,

538
00:40:43,287 --> 00:40:46,882
I would have you thrown
down the cliff into the boy.

539
00:40:52,887 --> 00:40:55,162
That's very funny. Very funny.

540
00:40:56,967 --> 00:41:01,563
What exactly does it say?.
Can you see anything?

541
00:41:01,727 --> 00:41:03,718
Oh, yes, it's very clear.

542
00:41:03,887 --> 00:41:06,765
It confirms my worse fears
for your safety.

543
00:41:08,087 --> 00:41:11,204
Extraordinary how accurate
these things are.

544
00:41:11,767 --> 00:41:15,282
How would have thought I could have
made a decision about you

545
00:41:15,447 --> 00:41:18,086
and seen it clearly reflected
in your chart?.

546
00:41:18,247 --> 00:41:20,556
Perhaps you've cast it wrong.

547
00:41:20,727 --> 00:41:23,036
Not as wrong
as you've been casting mine.

548
00:41:23,207 --> 00:41:26,358
There's news coming from that boat.
I'm sure of it.

549
00:41:26,527 --> 00:41:29,758
Didn't you see the eagle
on your roof this morning?

550
00:41:29,927 --> 00:41:31,997
There are no eagles in Rhodes.

551
00:41:32,167 --> 00:41:34,123
Exactly!

552
00:41:34,887 --> 00:41:37,640
Yet the whole town
was pointing at it.

553
00:41:37,807 --> 00:41:40,367
It can mean only one thing -
good news.

554
00:41:40,527 --> 00:41:43,485
Alas, but not for you. Sentor!

555
00:41:43,647 --> 00:41:48,277
Let me look at the chart.
A man's destiny is not so easily read.

556
00:41:48,447 --> 00:41:51,803
Yours is. I wrote it myself
this morning.

557
00:41:52,807 --> 00:41:56,197
Sentor, escort my friend
down the cliff path.

558
00:41:56,367 --> 00:41:59,564
And take care, I have
a terrible feeling he may slip.

559
00:41:59,727 --> 00:42:01,638
His stars speak of disasters.

560
00:42:01,807 --> 00:42:05,356
Yes, master. An imperial courier
has arrived with despatches.

561
00:42:05,527 --> 00:42:08,280
Show him out.
My friend can wait a while.

562
00:42:12,647 --> 00:42:17,960
You see, a horoscope, like the heart
of a man, is not so easy to read.

563
00:42:18,127 --> 00:42:21,278
Let's see what the despatches say,
shall we?

564
00:42:22,207 --> 00:42:26,200
Your prophecies haven't inspired
much confidence lately.

565
00:42:27,927 --> 00:42:32,000
Imperial despatch from Augustus
Caesar for Tiberius Claudius Nero.

566
00:42:58,567 --> 00:43:01,923
Lucius is dead.
I am to return to Rome.

567
00:43:02,727 --> 00:43:04,558
Dead?

568
00:43:06,047 --> 00:43:07,366
Dead.

569
00:43:09,487 --> 00:43:11,205
Dead?

570
00:43:12,287 --> 00:43:13,845
Dead.

571
00:43:28,807 --> 00:43:32,083
Sir, all Rome is drowned in grief.

572
00:43:33,127 --> 00:43:36,119
Well. of course they are.
That's only natural

573
00:43:40,207 --> 00:43:44,723
- What happened?
- A terrible boating accident.

574
00:43:44,887 --> 00:43:46,878
A boating accident?.

575
00:43:50,927 --> 00:43:52,918
- Where?
- In Marseilles.

576
00:43:53,087 --> 00:43:55,681
He was on his way to Spain.
He and his friend.

577
00:43:55,847 --> 00:43:58,281
- His friend?
- Caius Plautinus Silvanus.

578
00:43:58,447 --> 00:44:01,757
They were waiting for the boat
to take them to Spain.

579
00:44:01,927 --> 00:44:04,157
While they waited,
they went fishing.

580
00:44:04,327 --> 00:44:05,646
Fishing?

581
00:44:10,447 --> 00:44:13,598
I don't understand.
Why are you laughing?

582
00:44:13,767 --> 00:44:16,440
It's nervous laughter.

583
00:44:18,687 --> 00:44:21,042
Go on with your story.

584
00:44:25,447 --> 00:44:27,324
Well. go on, go on.

585
00:44:27,487 --> 00:44:29,842
The boat overturned.

586
00:44:30,007 --> 00:44:33,716
- Overturned?
- Yes. Shall I go on?

587
00:44:35,447 --> 00:44:37,642
Plautius behaved like a hero.

588
00:44:37,807 --> 00:44:41,641
He swam for two miles
holding on to his friend trying to save him,

589
00:44:41,807 --> 00:44:44,446
but when he got to shore,
his friend was dead

590
00:44:44,607 --> 00:44:47,041
and he was in a state of exhaustion.

591
00:44:48,127 --> 00:44:50,118
What a terrible thing.

592
00:44:50,287 --> 00:44:54,838
Gaius and Lucius within 18 months...

593
00:44:55,847 --> 00:44:58,122
and their mother banished
in between.

594
00:44:59,767 --> 00:45:04,124
That family is beginning
to resemble a Greek tragedy.

595
00:45:05,807 --> 00:45:09,243
- Is your ship returning to Rome?
- Yes, sir. Tomorrow.

596
00:45:09,407 --> 00:45:12,638
We’ll join it. You may go now.

597
00:45:21,687 --> 00:45:24,121
Curious the fates are.

598
00:45:24,287 --> 00:45:27,040
My exile ended and you predicted it.

599
00:45:28,287 --> 00:45:30,721
Brave Thrasyllus.

600
00:45:32,167 --> 00:45:34,283
I never lost faith in you.

601
00:45:55,527 --> 00:45:58,758
So you've come home?

602
00:45:58,927 --> 00:46:00,440
Yes, Caesar.

603
00:46:02,047 --> 00:46:04,038
I am here to do whatever you want.

604
00:46:06,327 --> 00:46:08,921
Well. let bygones be bygones, eh?

605
00:46:09,087 --> 00:46:13,717
Families quarrel. they make it up.
That's in the nature of things.

606
00:46:18,807 --> 00:46:21,879
My two grandsons are dead.

607
00:46:28,047 --> 00:46:29,685
My daughter...

608
00:46:30,127 --> 00:46:32,846
People say, "Bring her back".

609
00:46:33,007 --> 00:46:35,567
They shout at me in the street.
You know that?.

610
00:46:37,047 --> 00:46:39,481
"Wicked!" they say. "Bring her back."

611
00:46:39,647 --> 00:46:41,877
But no, no, no, no.

612
00:46:42,047 --> 00:46:45,801
She's not my daughter anymore.
I've forgotten her.

613
00:46:49,207 --> 00:46:52,165
Anyway, we'll talk later.

614
00:46:53,167 --> 00:46:56,045
There's a lot to be done.
Trouble in Germany.

615
00:46:56,207 --> 00:47:00,564
The Parthians are at it again.
That king always stirring up trouble.

616
00:47:00,727 --> 00:47:04,197
I've got his son as a hostage.
I swore I'd execute him.

617
00:47:05,567 --> 00:47:08,206
But he's such a likeable
little chap.

618
00:47:09,327 --> 00:47:12,842
Anyway, we'll talk later.

619
00:47:14,407 --> 00:47:15,920
Later.

620
00:47:23,367 --> 00:47:28,839
The likeable little chap is now
the king who's causing all the trouble.

621
00:47:29,007 --> 00:47:30,998
His mind is going.

622
00:47:31,167 --> 00:47:32,805
Yes.

623
00:47:34,207 --> 00:47:39,281
But mine isn't. You'll dine with me
tonight and we'll talk.

624
00:47:41,527 --> 00:47:43,085
Yes, Mother.

625
00:47:47,127 --> 00:47:50,324
Ch-ch-cheer up, Postumus.

626
00:47:51,407 --> 00:47:53,716
Come and play nuts.

627
00:47:58,447 --> 00:48:02,042
What's the m-m-matter?.

628
00:48:03,527 --> 00:48:05,085
Nothing.

629
00:48:06,567 --> 00:48:09,081
Oh, sir, be cheerful

630
00:48:09,247 --> 00:48:13,160
Caesar has adopted you
into his family and made you his heir.

631
00:48:13,327 --> 00:48:16,842
That is an honour.
It means you'll succeed him.

632
00:48:18,407 --> 00:48:19,999
Yes, Herod.

633
00:48:21,887 --> 00:48:24,879
But he's adopted my stepfather
too...

634
00:48:26,167 --> 00:48:30,046
and we both can't succeed him,
can we?

635
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:39,238
I'm frightened.

636
00:48:40,687 --> 00:48:42,678
I want my mother.

637
00:48:43,767 --> 00:48:45,758
I want my brothers.

638
00:48:46,767 --> 00:48:48,485
Where are they?.

639
00:48:50,527 --> 00:48:52,279
Where are they?.
