1
00:00:56,927 --> 00:00:58,679
(HE SIGHS)

2
00:00:58,847 --> 00:01:00,519
Does it hurt?.

3
00:01:00,687 --> 00:01:03,804
Of course it hurts.
Do you think I'm made of wood?

4
00:01:06,927 --> 00:01:08,246
Oh.

5
00:01:09,167 --> 00:01:13,126
- I didn't mean to scratch so hard.
- And I'm on stage today.

6
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:17,246
No one will see.
You'll have your clothes on.

7
00:01:17,407 --> 00:01:19,204
I'm doing Ulysses and Circe.

8
00:01:19,367 --> 00:01:23,519
When I'm washed up on the beach,
my dear, I'm naked to the waist.

9
00:01:24,087 --> 00:01:27,477
- That's not in the play.
- It is when I perform it.

10
00:01:29,207 --> 00:01:32,677
- Where are you going?
- To the theatre.

11
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:35,206
Stay here.

12
00:01:35,687 --> 00:01:38,155
I have a performance to give.

13
00:01:38,327 --> 00:01:40,682
You can give it here, just for me.

14
00:01:40,847 --> 00:01:42,838
I've already performed for you.

15
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:48,359
Don't be insolent.

16
00:01:51,167 --> 00:01:55,957
No, no, no. You shouldn't
hit my face. I am an actor.

17
00:01:57,327 --> 00:01:59,795
And that's all you are.
Just remember that.

18
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:04,925
Why do I put up with you?

19
00:02:05,087 --> 00:02:07,885
Because you're bored
and I make you laugh.

20
00:02:08,487 --> 00:02:11,240
- Do you think I'm bored?
- Oh, unbelievably.

21
00:02:11,407 --> 00:02:15,764
You would crack the universe open
if you could to see what would happen.

22
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:17,724
Well. you may be right.

23
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:21,880
You ought to have accompanied
the Emperor on his invasion of Britain.

24
00:02:23,007 --> 00:02:25,396
They say the men there are so savage

25
00:02:25,567 --> 00:02:28,604
that the women live
in a permanent state of ecstasy.

26
00:02:28,767 --> 00:02:32,237
I should have been an actor
or a sculptor.

27
00:02:32,407 --> 00:02:34,682
They never seem to get bored.

28
00:02:35,527 --> 00:02:39,076
They have their art,
but what do I have?

29
00:02:39,247 --> 00:02:40,965
You have your lovers.

30
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:43,357
- Oh, my lovers!
- Hmm.

31
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:51,480
When I make love, I reach for
something that men never dream of.

32
00:02:51,647 --> 00:02:53,444
Oh. What's that?.

33
00:02:55,927 --> 00:02:57,440
I don't know.

34
00:02:58,687 --> 00:03:02,600
But it's there -
always just out of reach.

35
00:03:05,687 --> 00:03:11,239
Sometimes I feel as if I could take
on the whole of Rome in a night

36
00:03:11,407 --> 00:03:13,841
and be no worse for it
in the morning.

37
00:03:14,007 --> 00:03:15,838
Well. why don't you?

38
00:03:17,127 --> 00:03:19,243
You'll mock me once too often
some day!

39
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:22,365
No, I'm not mocking you.
I'm serious.

40
00:03:22,527 --> 00:03:26,600
We could stage the greatest night
of love the world has ever seen.

41
00:03:27,767 --> 00:03:31,965
A tournament of sex. We could
challenge the Guild of Prostitutes

42
00:03:32,127 --> 00:03:34,721
to provide a champion
to compote with you.

43
00:03:35,287 --> 00:03:37,642
Who would last the longest?.

44
00:03:39,447 --> 00:03:42,484
The Interminable
versus the Inexhaustible!

45
00:03:46,607 --> 00:03:48,404
You're mad!

46
00:03:50,447 --> 00:03:52,961
There's no one
who could compote with me.

47
00:03:53,127 --> 00:03:55,038
Oh, no?

48
00:03:57,167 --> 00:04:00,557
What about that Sicilian woman?
What's her name? Scylla.

49
00:04:00,727 --> 00:04:02,718
Don't underestimate her.

50
00:04:03,647 --> 00:04:07,037
They say she boards a ship at Ostia,
works the whole crew,

51
00:04:07,207 --> 00:04:09,243
then walks off steadier than them.

52
00:04:13,047 --> 00:04:15,163
- Are you serious?
- Why not?.

53
00:04:16,207 --> 00:04:19,358
Why not?. What a spectacle
it would make.

54
00:04:19,527 --> 00:04:24,396
Two tidal waves of male passion
dashing their fury

55
00:04:24,567 --> 00:04:27,161
against two timeless rock of love!

56
00:04:27,327 --> 00:04:31,286
Who will be the first to yield?
Who will be the first to break?

57
00:04:31,687 --> 00:04:34,645
Oh, why, it would be unprecedented.

58
00:04:35,687 --> 00:04:38,406
Copulation on a cosmic scale

59
00:04:38,567 --> 00:04:41,923
to set the universe ringing
to the cheers of the gods.

60
00:04:42,327 --> 00:04:44,557
- Do you think I'd win?
- Who can tell?.

61
00:04:45,367 --> 00:04:49,918
That Sicilian woman, they say,
she's formidable.

62
00:04:50,687 --> 00:04:52,837
But I am more so.

63
00:04:57,327 --> 00:05:00,046
Now I know why I put up with you.

64
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,603
Bring on your Sicilian.

65
00:05:05,247 --> 00:05:07,317
And let her look to her laurels.

66
00:05:13,967 --> 00:05:16,800
They’ve taken 8,000 prisoners
and counted nearly 5,000 corpses.

67
00:05:16,967 --> 00:05:18,878
Caractacus has fled Colchester.

68
00:05:19,047 --> 00:05:21,641
Aulus has taken the Ninth Cavalry
in pursuit.

69
00:05:21,807 --> 00:05:24,196
- And our losses?
- Oh, insignificant.

70
00:05:25,127 --> 00:05:27,721
380 killed and 600 wounded.

71
00:05:28,487 --> 00:05:32,082
Britain is almost subdued.
The Emperor's on his way home.

72
00:05:33,287 --> 00:05:34,686
Er...

73
00:05:40,567 --> 00:05:44,116
If he's on his way home,
it solves our problem.

74
00:05:45,847 --> 00:05:48,202
- About Messalina?
- Yes.

75
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:52,363
It solves the problem
of whether we should write to him.

76
00:05:52,527 --> 00:05:55,439
Whether we should tell him
is another matter.

77
00:06:00,847 --> 00:06:04,283
Then it becomes the same problem
we had before he left.

78
00:06:05,487 --> 00:06:08,718
(ALL SHOUT) Galla's Hair!

79
00:06:09,367 --> 00:06:13,280
"The golden hair that Galla wears
is hers.

80
00:06:13,447 --> 00:06:15,165
"Who would have thought it?.

81
00:06:15,327 --> 00:06:19,764
"She swears it's hers,
and true she swears

82
00:06:19,927 --> 00:06:22,077
"For I know where she bought it!"

83
00:06:23,607 --> 00:06:26,075
Oh, come, Mnester.

84
00:06:30,927 --> 00:06:36,559
"You ask me how my farm can pay,
since little it will bear.

85
00:06:36,967 --> 00:06:41,722
"It pays me thus - 'tis far away
and you are never there!"

86
00:06:44,727 --> 00:06:48,959
The woman Scylla! President
of the Guild of Prostitutes!"

87
00:06:57,767 --> 00:07:00,076
Sh!

88
00:07:02,287 --> 00:07:04,278
Permit me to introduce myself.

89
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:07,803
My name is Mnester. I am an actor.

90
00:07:07,967 --> 00:07:10,037
Most people have heard of me.

91
00:07:10,967 --> 00:07:14,960
My name is Scylla and I'm a whore.
Everybody's heard of me.

92
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:20,640
Allow me to introduce you
to the Lady Messalina.

93
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:23,560
Your challenger,
and the Emperor's wife.

94
00:07:24,847 --> 00:07:27,839
This is Scylla the Sicilian
and anybody's wife.

95
00:07:29,087 --> 00:07:32,159
- I am honoured.
- You are most welcome.

96
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:36,115
They said you were beautiful.
but they did you small justice.

97
00:07:37,327 --> 00:07:39,204
You are most generous.

98
00:07:39,367 --> 00:07:42,165
It was sporting of you
to accept the challenge.

99
00:07:42,327 --> 00:07:43,760
Sporting?

100
00:07:44,967 --> 00:07:46,958
I see. There's no money in it?.

101
00:07:47,327 --> 00:07:50,876
You're here for the honour
and to defend your reputation.

102
00:07:51,047 --> 00:07:53,641
Would you defend yours for nothing,
Greek?

103
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:57,719
Lady, I'm a professional
I work for money.

104
00:07:57,887 --> 00:08:00,196
The honour I gladly leave to you.

105
00:08:01,287 --> 00:08:05,599
What impudence! She expects
to be paid, and in this company!

106
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:09,240
The difference between you and me,
actor,

107
00:08:09,407 --> 00:08:11,398
is you're a snob and I'm not.

108
00:08:11,567 --> 00:08:15,003
And the difference
between this great lady and myself

109
00:08:15,167 --> 00:08:17,397
is that my work is her hobby.

110
00:08:17,567 --> 00:08:21,560
My hobby happens to be gardening,
for which I don't expect to be paid.

111
00:08:23,967 --> 00:08:27,482
You shall have your money.
Shall we say...?

112
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:29,000
Five?

113
00:08:29,167 --> 00:08:31,635
Three gold pieces a head?

114
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:35,959
"A head" seems an odd way
to describe it.

115
00:08:36,927 --> 00:08:38,838
Win or lose, of course?

116
00:08:40,847 --> 00:08:43,566
- That seems satisfactory.
- Satisfactory?.

117
00:08:43,727 --> 00:08:46,161
You've never earned so much
in a year.

118
00:08:46,327 --> 00:08:49,125
This Greek will drive me
to distraction.

119
00:08:49,287 --> 00:08:52,438
- Nothing I say pleases him.
- Let us begin.

120
00:08:53,527 --> 00:08:56,325
Which side of the bed do you proffer?.

121
00:08:57,047 --> 00:08:58,878
Left or right?.

122
00:08:59,807 --> 00:09:02,924
Lady, give me a support for my back,

123
00:09:03,087 --> 00:09:05,806
and "Let the Games begin,"
as they say.

124
00:09:09,847 --> 00:09:11,997
Let the Games begin!

125
00:09:12,167 --> 00:09:15,045
Do you know what's going on
at the now palace?

126
00:09:15,207 --> 00:09:18,119
The Emperor's wife is comparing
with a prostitute

127
00:09:18,287 --> 00:09:20,437
to see who can wear out
the most men!

128
00:09:20,607 --> 00:09:23,565
Well. that is shocking.
I can hardly believe it.

129
00:09:23,727 --> 00:09:27,959
I've had my suspicions for weeks,
but this is the final straw.

130
00:09:28,127 --> 00:09:31,563
- Something must be done.
- Have you told anyone else?

131
00:09:31,727 --> 00:09:34,764
- Only my immediate superior.
- Colonel Ruffrius?

132
00:09:34,927 --> 00:09:37,122
- Yes.
- When did you discuss it?.

133
00:09:37,287 --> 00:09:40,006
A weak ago, before I had any proof.

134
00:09:40,167 --> 00:09:43,637
And he advised you to wait
for the Emperor's return?

135
00:09:43,807 --> 00:09:46,275
Yes, and I did wait,
but this is too much.

136
00:09:46,447 --> 00:09:49,166
I think you must write
to the Emperor at once.

137
00:09:50,567 --> 00:09:53,923
I don't think you can put
that sort of thing in a letter.

138
00:09:55,607 --> 00:09:57,086
I see.

139
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:59,477
Well. maybe you can't, but I can!

140
00:10:00,127 --> 00:10:01,446
Justus.

141
00:10:03,087 --> 00:10:06,682
I think you have been
immensely foolish.

142
00:10:07,327 --> 00:10:09,557
- Are you threatening me?
- No.

143
00:10:09,727 --> 00:10:12,719
But did you not know
that Colonel Ruffrius

144
00:10:12,887 --> 00:10:15,765
was one of the Lady Messalina's
inner circle of friends?

145
00:10:17,487 --> 00:10:22,561
If you have confided in him, he has
most certainly confided in her.

146
00:10:23,687 --> 00:10:27,760
I'd say she's already applied to the Emperor
for your execution warrant.

147
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:29,724
My execution?

148
00:10:30,687 --> 00:10:33,997
- Are you serious? On what grounds?
- Does it matter?.

149
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:35,725
Conspiracy.

150
00:10:35,887 --> 00:10:39,960
Emperors are very nervous when
they’re away, they’ll sign anything.

151
00:10:40,447 --> 00:10:44,440
If I'm any judge, that warrant's
on its way back here now.

152
00:10:46,487 --> 00:10:47,966
You mean...?

153
00:10:50,287 --> 00:10:55,202
What are we to do? You must help me.
You must back me up. You must!

154
00:10:55,367 --> 00:11:00,805
I will choose my own time to tell him,
not yours or anyone else's.

155
00:11:02,007 --> 00:11:05,966
I have learned to tread very carefully
in a burning building.

156
00:11:15,247 --> 00:11:17,124
What am I to do?

157
00:11:18,127 --> 00:11:20,163
What can a dead man do?

158
00:11:21,207 --> 00:11:22,845
Go and get buried.

159
00:11:25,327 --> 00:11:29,684
"Then victory hath conceded been!
The Queen is dead...

160
00:11:30,527 --> 00:11:32,518
"Long live the Queen!"

161

(MESSALINA) Come back, you whore!
We're not finished.

162
00:11:37,367 --> 00:11:39,005
She's inhuman.

163
00:11:39,167 --> 00:11:42,125
Her insides must be
made out of old army boots.

164
00:11:44,167 --> 00:11:46,920
The money. Where's my money?.

165
00:11:47,087 --> 00:11:51,558
Here, Lady, here.
Three gold pieces per head.

166
00:11:51,727 --> 00:11:54,446
Will you take them
or shall I have them sent?.

167
00:11:55,167 --> 00:11:56,759
I'll take it.

168
00:12:05,007 --> 00:12:06,599
Amateurs!

169
00:12:24,207 --> 00:12:27,961
(TRUMPET FANFARE)

170
00:12:36,287 --> 00:12:38,596
(CHEERING)

171
00:12:54,567 --> 00:12:56,080
Senators.

172
00:12:56,247 --> 00:13:00,365
We have re-established Britain
as a province of Rome

173
00:13:00,527 --> 00:13:05,726
108 years
after the Divine Julius left it -

174
00:13:06,367 --> 00:13:08,437
not very well secured.

175
00:13:08,607 --> 00:13:12,316
It has again become p-part
of the Roman world.

176
00:13:12,487 --> 00:13:18,278
When I left, Caractacus,
our principal enemy, was in f-full flight.

177
00:13:18,447 --> 00:13:21,007
We had won a great victory.

178
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:27,440
(CLAUDIUS) A Roman Triumph
is seldom granted,

179
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:29,325
but they granted one to me.

180
00:13:29,487 --> 00:13:32,797
Me - Claudius the Idiot,
the Stammerer, the Fool

181
00:13:32,967 --> 00:13:37,279
But what life gives with one hand,
it takes back with the other.

182
00:13:37,447 --> 00:13:40,644
I would gladly have foregone
my Triumph

183
00:13:40,807 --> 00:13:43,275
for the tragedy
that was about to unfold.

184
00:13:44,207 --> 00:13:47,165
Shortly before I left
for the invasion of Britain,

185
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:50,160
Marsus Vibius, my Governor of Syria

186
00:13:50,327 --> 00:13:53,603
had written to me
giving me the startling news

187
00:13:53,767 --> 00:13:58,079
that my old friend Herod Agrippa
was fortifying Jerusalem.

188
00:13:58,247 --> 00:14:01,444
I had hastily written
to Marsus Vibius

189
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:03,563
asking him to find out more

190
00:14:03,727 --> 00:14:06,685
and report to me personally
on my return.

191
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:09,566
D-do you think
this is directed against us?

192
00:14:09,727 --> 00:14:12,002
Yes, Caesar. But there's more.

193
00:14:12,647 --> 00:14:17,084
I learned he was organising
a secret meeting with neighbouring kings.

194
00:14:17,247 --> 00:14:19,397
He is plotting a revolt
against Rome.

195
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:23,116
- But why?. Why?.
- Do his motives matter?.

196
00:14:23,287 --> 00:14:25,755
Well. they do to me.

197
00:14:26,527 --> 00:14:28,518
I'll tell you something, Marsus.

198
00:14:28,687 --> 00:14:32,202
Before I left, I had a letter
from Herod's uncle, Antipas.

199
00:14:32,367 --> 00:14:34,198
It was full of gossip, as usual.

200
00:14:34,367 --> 00:14:37,484
but, during it,
he said that he was convinced

201
00:14:37,647 --> 00:14:40,923
Herod believed himself
to be this Jewish Messiah

202
00:14:41,087 --> 00:14:43,043
whose coming has been prophesied.

203
00:14:43,207 --> 00:14:46,040
Yes. Well. others
have thought that too.

204
00:14:46,207 --> 00:14:48,437
Your nephew Caligula for one.

205
00:14:48,607 --> 00:14:51,838
- Yes.
- Perhaps it was him.

206
00:14:52,007 --> 00:14:57,127
No. Caligula filled the requirements
of the prophecy in many respects,

207
00:14:57,287 --> 00:15:02,486
except he did not die in the year
foretold by T-Thrasyllus,

208
00:15:02,647 --> 00:15:05,480
and Thrasyllus was never wrong
about dates.

209
00:15:05,647 --> 00:15:09,925
When was this Messiah supposed
to die, according to Thrasyllus?

210
00:15:10,087 --> 00:15:12,806
In the same year as my grandmother,
Livia.

211
00:15:12,967 --> 00:15:16,562
If the Messiah is already dead,
it can't be Herod Agrippa.

212
00:15:16,727 --> 00:15:20,800
But Herod is a Jew. He wouldn't
believe anything Thrasyllus said.

213
00:15:20,967 --> 00:15:24,039
Well. where does
all this speculation get us?

214
00:15:24,207 --> 00:15:28,166
If he's planning a revolt
against Rome, does it matter why?.

215
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:30,397
He's my dearest friend.

216
00:15:30,567 --> 00:15:33,479
If he becomes my enemy,
I want to know why!

217
00:15:33,647 --> 00:15:38,402
What do you know about the M-Messiah
in the literature of the Jews?

218
00:15:38,567 --> 00:15:41,877
Very little, but I can find out
and make a report.

219
00:15:42,047 --> 00:15:43,844
I have Jewish agents in Jerusalem.

220
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:49,636
- Am I interrupting?
- No, no, come in.

221
00:15:49,807 --> 00:15:54,244
Marsus Vibius was just reporting
the very grave situation in J-Jerusalem.

222
00:15:54,407 --> 00:15:56,398
We'll meat later and talk some more.

223
00:15:56,567 --> 00:15:58,205
Caesar. Lady.

224
00:16:04,727 --> 00:16:07,287
- Are you worried?
- Hm? Oh.

225
00:16:07,927 --> 00:16:12,921
Hurt that my old friend should...
Well. there may be nothing in it.

226
00:16:13,087 --> 00:16:18,286
I missed you so very much
while I was away. And the children.

227
00:16:18,447 --> 00:16:22,156
I never rested properly
a single night thinking about you.

228
00:16:22,327 --> 00:16:24,363
What would I do without you?

229
00:16:24,527 --> 00:16:28,361
When you wrote to me about
the Q-Quintus Justus affair,

230
00:16:28,527 --> 00:16:31,997
I thought, "Thank heavens
Messalina's taking care of things."

231
00:16:33,967 --> 00:16:37,721
Well. do you want something
specially?.

232
00:16:39,007 --> 00:16:42,204
Only to say that if I slipped
into your room tonight,

233
00:16:42,367 --> 00:16:44,403
would I find you alone in bed?

234
00:16:45,047 --> 00:16:47,197
- M-my love...!
- Sh!

235
00:16:47,367 --> 00:16:49,403
I'm not asking for details.

236
00:16:50,007 --> 00:16:54,159
Only that I shouldn't find
the little Calpurnia in my place.

237
00:16:54,327 --> 00:16:56,602
I know that she sometimes
visits you.

238
00:16:56,767 --> 00:16:59,964
Well. she's an old f-friend.

239
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:04,562
I don't mind a bit.
It's very good for your health.

240
00:17:05,447 --> 00:17:10,601
Oh, but sometimes I feel a great
desire to have your arms about me,

241
00:17:10,767 --> 00:17:13,440
and I should hate to embarrass you.

242
00:17:14,447 --> 00:17:18,599
Oh, come tonight, p-please.
I should be so grateful

243
00:17:20,727 --> 00:17:22,638
Be alone then.

244
00:17:26,487 --> 00:17:28,000
Oh...

245
00:17:28,887 --> 00:17:31,879
- There is one thing.
- Oh, anything.

246
00:17:32,887 --> 00:17:35,082
I wish you would speak to Mnester.

247
00:17:35,247 --> 00:17:38,364
He's got so big-headed lately
and insolent.

248
00:17:39,207 --> 00:17:42,040
During your absence,
he was very rude to me -

249
00:17:42,207 --> 00:17:47,201
making excuses for not putting on
some play that my friends wanted.

250
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:49,278
Couldn't you punish him yourself?.

251
00:17:49,447 --> 00:17:51,278
I didn't want to do that.

252
00:17:51,447 --> 00:17:53,563
He's a great favourite
with the crowd

253
00:17:53,727 --> 00:17:56,195
and they might have held that
against you.

254
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:58,085
I shall speak to him.

255
00:17:58,887 --> 00:18:01,447
Just tell him
that when I ask him to do something,

256
00:18:01,607 --> 00:18:04,758
he is to do it and not make a fuss.

257
00:18:06,407 --> 00:18:08,363
I was her slave.

258
00:18:08,527 --> 00:18:11,678
Is there anything so foolish
as an old man in love?

259
00:18:12,207 --> 00:18:14,402
Well, I spoke to Mnester.

260
00:18:14,567 --> 00:18:17,320
"Listen, little Greek, " I said.

261
00:18:17,487 --> 00:18:20,320
"If the Lady Messalina
tells you to do anything,

262
00:18:20,487 --> 00:18:22,955
"you will obey,,

263
00:18:24,167 --> 00:18:26,158
"Anything?" he asked..

264
00:18:26,767 --> 00:18:29,201
"Anything, " I said to him.

265
00:18:30,087 --> 00:18:33,284
I played, as usual,
into Messalina's hands.

266
00:18:33,927 --> 00:18:37,397
She had fallen manically in love
with Gaius Silius,

267
00:18:37,567 --> 00:18:41,003
the Consul-Elect
and the handsomest man in Rome.

268
00:18:41,967 --> 00:18:44,925
Knowing Mnester to be
on close terms with the family,

269
00:18:45,087 --> 00:18:47,726
she had asked. him
to bring Silius to see her.

270
00:18:47,887 --> 00:18:51,323
Mnester had refused
out of respect for Silius' wife.

271
00:18:51,487 --> 00:18:54,160
Hence Messalina's complaints
to me.

272
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:58,681
Like a fool, I secured for her
what she most wanted.

273
00:19:00,207 --> 00:19:04,439
He was not an easy victim
of her passion, but she was clever..

274
00:19:05,527 --> 00:19:09,361
She did not talk at first of love,
but of politics.

275
00:19:10,007 --> 00:19:13,636
Tiberius had executed his father
and she played, on that,

276
00:19:13,807 --> 00:19:17,436
telling him that I was
more corrupt even than Tiberius

277
00:19:18,927 --> 00:19:22,806
Before he realised it,
he was comforting her.

278
00:19:23,367 --> 00:19:27,804
Before he realised it,
he was making love to her.

279
00:19:28,847 --> 00:19:32,556
He was as much her abject slave
as I was.

280
00:19:33,527 --> 00:19:36,837
Claudius, Claudius,
you go too fast.

281
00:19:37,487 --> 00:19:38,966
Too fast.

282
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:42,480
More grave news
of the situation in Jerusalem

283
00:19:42,647 --> 00:19:45,923
was hurried to me by Marsus
from his agent, Catalus.

284
00:19:46,087 --> 00:19:50,603
Yes, but what exactly
is this M-Messiah?

285
00:19:50,767 --> 00:19:55,966
A king, Caesar, who is to come
and redeem Israel of all its sins.

286
00:19:56,127 --> 00:19:58,516
Philo, their greatest living scholar,

287
00:19:58,687 --> 00:20:01,759
has declared that he must be
descended from King David

288
00:20:01,927 --> 00:20:03,918
and born in a village called...

289
00:20:05,647 --> 00:20:06,966
Ah.

290
00:20:09,847 --> 00:20:12,281
What?. Bethlehem.

291
00:20:14,847 --> 00:20:16,724
- B-Bethlehem?
- Yes.

292
00:20:16,887 --> 00:20:18,764
In w=what year?.

293
00:20:18,927 --> 00:20:23,079
Well. opinions differ, as they
always will in events of this kind.

294
00:20:23,247 --> 00:20:25,602
Have there been any candidates
recently?.

295
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:30,079
Not recently. The last one, I heard
from a Jew, died fifteen years ago.

296
00:20:31,047 --> 00:20:33,117
- Fifteen?
- Yes.

297
00:20:33,287 --> 00:20:35,278
Is that significant?.

298
00:20:39,967 --> 00:20:41,559
Who was this man?

299
00:20:41,727 --> 00:20:46,357
His name was Joshua Bar-Joseph,
a native of Galilea.

300
00:20:46,527 --> 00:20:49,405
He had a large following
amongst the uneducated

301
00:20:49,567 --> 00:20:52,604
and used to preach to gatherings
by the lakeside.

302
00:20:53,207 --> 00:20:55,641
He was also called Jesus
by the Greeks.

303
00:20:55,807 --> 00:20:58,275
And was he born in...?

304
00:21:03,047 --> 00:21:05,083
- Bethlehem?
- B-Bethlehem.

305
00:21:05,247 --> 00:21:10,037
It's not precisely known. There was
some scandal concerning his birth.

306
00:21:10,207 --> 00:21:14,837
A Greek was said to have seduced
his mother, who was a tapestry worker.

307
00:21:18,327 --> 00:21:21,524
What happened to this Joshua?

308
00:21:21,687 --> 00:21:24,918
He tried to form a new religion
out of Judaism,

309
00:21:25,087 --> 00:21:29,717
but he lacked authority. He began
identifying himself as this Messiah.

310
00:21:29,887 --> 00:21:31,764
He was executed as a heretic.

311
00:21:31,927 --> 00:21:34,395
Do you know what King Herod
thought of him?

312
00:21:34,567 --> 00:21:39,482
Not much, I imagine. He recently executed
one of his followers called James.

313
00:21:39,647 --> 00:21:42,115
- He's looking for a Simon.
- He has followers?

314
00:21:42,287 --> 00:21:46,485
Oh, yes, yes, yes. It's a cult.
There are always cults.

315
00:21:54,727 --> 00:21:57,446
All this is most interesting
for you, Caesar,

316
00:21:57,607 --> 00:22:00,485
with your fascination
for strange religions.

317
00:22:00,647 --> 00:22:03,525
But what does it tell us
of Herod's intentions?

318
00:22:03,687 --> 00:22:05,723
I will tell you, Pallas.

319
00:22:05,887 --> 00:22:09,357
King Herod's mother was on her way
to Jerusalem for her lying-in

320
00:22:09,527 --> 00:22:12,246
when she was overtaken by her pains
in a village.

321
00:22:12,407 --> 00:22:16,639
King Herod was born there. The name
of the village was B-Bethlehem.

322
00:22:17,847 --> 00:22:19,997
There is no doubt in my mind.

323
00:22:20,167 --> 00:22:23,477
My friend Herod believes himself
to be this Messiah.

324
00:22:23,647 --> 00:22:26,844
And worse - many others believe him
to be this Messiah.

325
00:22:27,007 --> 00:22:31,717
His intentions are clear. On this
great wave of religious fanaticism,

326
00:22:31,887 --> 00:22:35,197
he intends to free the east
from the dominion of Rome.

327
00:22:35,367 --> 00:22:38,564
He intends to make w=war on us.
Marsus is right.

328
00:22:38,727 --> 00:22:42,037
If we don't move quickly,
Herod will seize the Eastern Empire

329
00:22:42,207 --> 00:22:44,277
and we shall lose Egypt.

330
00:22:45,287 --> 00:22:47,676
My friend has become my enemy.

331
00:22:56,447 --> 00:22:58,358
What are you doing with that?.

332
00:22:58,527 --> 00:23:00,677
The mistress told us
to take it down.

333
00:23:00,847 --> 00:23:02,439
But why?.

334
00:23:02,607 --> 00:23:05,519
If there's a mark on it,
I'll have you whipped.

335
00:23:05,687 --> 00:23:07,962
- Where is it going?
- Hurry up with it!

336
00:23:08,127 --> 00:23:10,243
I'm giving it to someone
as a present.

337
00:23:10,407 --> 00:23:12,443
- To Silius?
- Yes.

338
00:23:12,927 --> 00:23:15,487
Iris! I want my hair dressed!

339
00:23:18,127 --> 00:23:20,402
That was a present
from your husband.

340
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:24,685
I know that. Silius fell in love
with it, so I'm giving it to him.

341
00:23:24,847 --> 00:23:28,157
- And if he finds that it's gone?
- He doesn't come here.

342
00:23:28,327 --> 00:23:31,160
If he does, I'll tell him
I've put it somewhere else.

343
00:23:32,687 --> 00:23:35,155
Have you taken leave of your senses?

344
00:23:35,327 --> 00:23:37,682
Have your wits
deserted you entirely?.

345
00:23:37,847 --> 00:23:41,635
You have lavished gifts on that man
from all directions...

346
00:23:42,447 --> 00:23:44,915
half of them from the palace.

347
00:23:45,727 --> 00:23:49,800
Are you so much in love that you
have lost all sense of discretion?

348
00:23:50,287 --> 00:23:53,563
Yes. I am in love.

349
00:23:54,647 --> 00:23:57,719
But you've never imperilled
your life for it.

350
00:23:57,887 --> 00:23:59,923
I shan't imperil my life.

351
00:24:00,687 --> 00:24:04,362
All Rome knows that you visit him
openly at his house.

352
00:24:05,927 --> 00:24:09,602
And take him gifts. His wife
complains bitterly about it.

353
00:24:09,767 --> 00:24:11,485
He's divorcing his wife.

354
00:24:12,407 --> 00:24:14,363
Divorcing her?. For what reason?

355
00:24:14,527 --> 00:24:17,121
For no other reason
than he loves me.

356
00:24:17,287 --> 00:24:19,118
He'll need a better reason.

357
00:24:19,287 --> 00:24:23,041
They’re not married in the strict form.
It requires a declaration.

358
00:24:23,847 --> 00:24:26,680
But you are married!
You can't marry him.

359
00:24:26,847 --> 00:24:28,917
So why is he divorcing his wife?

360
00:24:29,087 --> 00:24:32,966
Because I can't bear him sharing
her bed when he gets out of mine!

361
00:24:35,567 --> 00:24:37,319
I heard nothing.

362
00:24:37,487 --> 00:24:41,526
Not a breath of the scandal that
was known to everyone else in Rome.

363
00:24:42,567 --> 00:24:44,558
Even the slaves

364
00:24:50,007 --> 00:24:51,998
They're laughing at me.

365
00:24:52,767 --> 00:24:56,726
Still, after all these years..

366
00:24:58,127 --> 00:25:00,118
still laughing at me.

367
00:25:04,687 --> 00:25:06,200
Herod.

368
00:25:06,367 --> 00:25:09,803
(HEROD) Trust no one, my friend.
No one.

369
00:25:12,327 --> 00:25:15,558
Yes, Caesar, dead.
Herod Agrippa is dead.

370
00:25:17,687 --> 00:25:19,006
How?.

371
00:25:20,367 --> 00:25:23,200
Tell me. Tell me what happened.

372
00:25:23,727 --> 00:25:26,799
Well. he had come up from Jerusalem
to Caesarea

373
00:25:26,967 --> 00:25:29,322
for the festival
in honour of your birthday.

374
00:25:29,487 --> 00:25:33,480
But really to meat with the kings
with whom he'd formed his alliance?

375
00:25:33,647 --> 00:25:38,084
Yes. Only Phoenician Tyre and Sidon
stood outside the alliance

376
00:25:38,247 --> 00:25:40,203
and now they had decided to join.

377
00:25:40,367 --> 00:25:44,360
Their formal submission was to be
made to Herod upon their arrival

378
00:25:45,407 --> 00:25:50,879
Did Herod truly believe himself
to be this Messiah?

379
00:25:51,607 --> 00:25:54,075
- This Anointed One?
- Oh, yes.

380
00:25:54,247 --> 00:25:56,886
Yes. He had revealed himself
to the High Priests.

381
00:25:57,047 --> 00:25:59,607
Now he was to reveal himself
to the nation.

382
00:26:02,247 --> 00:26:03,646
Go on.

383
00:26:03,807 --> 00:26:08,403
When he arrived in the amphitheatre,
the whole audience rose.

384
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:12,162
He was wearing a royal robe
of silver tissue

385
00:26:12,327 --> 00:26:16,878
that flashed in the sun so brightly
that it tired the ayes to look at it.

386
00:26:17,447 --> 00:26:21,076
The whole audience shouted,
"O King, live forever!"

387
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:24,284
But this was not enough
for the men of Tyre and Sidon.

388
00:26:24,447 --> 00:26:29,362
They grovelled at his feat and said,
"We repent of our ingratitude!

389
00:26:29,527 --> 00:26:33,566
"We see now that you are superior
to mortal nature."

390
00:26:33,727 --> 00:26:37,083
"Tyre and Sidon," he replied,
"you are forgiven."

391
00:26:37,247 --> 00:26:40,603
And they answered,
"It is the voice of God!"

392
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:46,080
"Thou shalt have no other gods
but me."

393
00:26:46,847 --> 00:26:50,920
Isn't that what the god
of the J-Jews has said?

394
00:26:51,327 --> 00:26:56,401
Yes, Caesar, but evidently
Herod had forgotten that.

395
00:26:57,447 --> 00:27:02,475
He was about to signal for the ram's
horn to be blown when he stopped.

396
00:27:02,647 --> 00:27:06,765
An owl flew into the arena, which
had been blinded by the sunlight.

397
00:27:06,927 --> 00:27:12,365
It perched on this throne,
hooted five times, and then flew off.

398
00:27:12,527 --> 00:27:14,597
An owl?. Yes.

399
00:27:15,407 --> 00:27:18,877
An owl was always an ill-omen
for Herod.

400
00:27:19,567 --> 00:27:21,523
Well. he groaned.

401
00:27:21,687 --> 00:27:24,247
He seemed to feel pains
in his chest,

402
00:27:24,407 --> 00:27:26,921
for he cried out,
"I am ill Carry me out!"

403
00:27:27,087 --> 00:27:29,123
They carried him out.

404
00:27:30,527 --> 00:27:32,916
And the ram's horn never blew.

405
00:27:33,087 --> 00:27:34,998
The crowd set up a wail

406
00:27:35,167 --> 00:27:37,727
The festival was over
before it had begun.

407
00:27:38,327 --> 00:27:41,239
And within five days, he was dead -

408
00:27:41,407 --> 00:27:44,365
his body racked with pain

409
00:27:44,527 --> 00:27:48,042
and rotted into an unrecognisable
mass of sores.

410
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:52,398
The kings departed
and the crowds went home.

411
00:27:53,207 --> 00:27:57,246
The storm passed
without a single drop of rain.

412
00:28:00,327 --> 00:28:02,158
And the Messiah?

413
00:28:03,207 --> 00:28:05,801
Who, then, is this M-Messiah?

414
00:28:07,087 --> 00:28:12,207
Who knows? Perhaps the Jews
must wait a little longer.

415
00:28:14,247 --> 00:28:15,726
Perhaps.

416
00:28:18,887 --> 00:28:21,799
(HEROD) Marmoset, I am dying.

417
00:28:22,847 --> 00:28:25,236
My body is full of maggots.

418
00:28:27,087 --> 00:28:29,043
Forgive me.

419
00:28:29,687 --> 00:28:32,281
Forgive your old friend
who loved you dearly

420
00:28:32,447 --> 00:28:35,644
yet secretly plotted
to take the East away from you.

421
00:28:36,927 --> 00:28:41,921
I have failed.
I played, too dangerous a game.

422
00:28:44,967 --> 00:28:49,882
Little marmoset you are a fool,
but I envy you your folly..

423
00:28:50,527 --> 00:28:54,406
Do not weep for me.
My punishment is just.

424
00:28:55,327 --> 00:28:58,478
I offended against
the only living God.

425
00:29:07,247 --> 00:29:12,480
Farewell, my friend, whom I love
more truly than you suppose.

426
00:29:13,087 --> 00:29:15,885
Farewell, little marmoset,
my school fellow...

427
00:29:17,007 --> 00:29:19,123
and trust no one.

428
00:29:19,287 --> 00:29:20,925
No one.

429
00:29:22,327 --> 00:29:26,320
Your dying friend, Herod Agrippa.

430
00:29:29,487 --> 00:29:31,478
(CLAUDIUS) I was alone.

431
00:29:32,447 --> 00:29:35,644
For the first time in my life,
I was alone.

432
00:29:36,967 --> 00:29:40,164
They were all gone now,
those friends of my youth.

433
00:29:41,127 --> 00:29:46,565
Germanicus Postumus, Castor,
Herod. All gone.

434
00:29:48,247 --> 00:29:51,922
There was no one now I could
turn to except Messalina.

435
00:29:52,087 --> 00:29:54,601
Yes she helped me.

436
00:29:55,487 --> 00:29:57,478
How she helped me

437
00:29:57,647 --> 00:30:01,083
She persuaded me to lot her 
the duplicate of my seal

438
00:30:02,087 --> 00:30:04,726
Say, "Fool, Claudius, fool!"

439
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:08,926
I know it I know it
But she was clever..

440
00:30:11,567 --> 00:30:14,877
I also began this most strange
history of my life,

441
00:30:15,047 --> 00:30:18,164
which you shall read and find,
I promise you.

442
00:30:18,327 --> 00:30:23,003
Now you shall see how my ignorance
of my own domestic affairs ended.

443
00:30:23,847 --> 00:30:26,725
I said I would tell all
and I shall

444
00:30:27,807 --> 00:30:32,437
Her adultery with Silius had gone
so smoothly that she was bored.

445
00:30:32,607 --> 00:30:35,246
Not with him,
but with their situation.

446
00:30:35,407 --> 00:30:38,240
While he began to feel
that the longer it went on,

447
00:30:38,407 --> 00:30:41,365
the greater the danger
of their being discovered.

448
00:30:41,527 --> 00:30:43,722
- Divorce him?
- Why not?.

449
00:30:43,887 --> 00:30:45,718
And marry you?

450
00:30:46,407 --> 00:30:48,841
Wouldn't you rather be my wife
than my mistress?

451
00:30:50,527 --> 00:30:52,119
Your wife?

452
00:30:53,407 --> 00:30:58,401
Oh, Gaius.
More than anything in the world.

453
00:31:00,007 --> 00:31:01,440
But how?.

454
00:31:01,607 --> 00:31:05,600
Divorce is simple. You send someone
to your husband and tell him.

455
00:31:05,767 --> 00:31:09,646
I know that. I meant
how would we do it and survive?

456
00:31:09,807 --> 00:31:12,241
We have gone far enough
with concealment.

457
00:31:12,407 --> 00:31:16,161
Sooner or later, he'll find out
and we'll be taken unprepared.

458
00:31:17,007 --> 00:31:20,716
No. It's safer to stay as we are.

459
00:31:22,367 --> 00:31:24,562
We can wait
until he dies of old age.

460
00:31:24,727 --> 00:31:26,957
I am tired of waiting!

461
00:31:28,687 --> 00:31:33,886
Gaius, don't you think
that I am tired of waiting too?

462
00:31:36,087 --> 00:31:39,238
Oh, don't turn your back on me,
please.

463
00:31:40,767 --> 00:31:45,079
Nothing would please me more
than to be your wife

464
00:31:45,247 --> 00:31:49,035
and belong to you entirely
for everyone to see.

465
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:55,246
But we've made a long-term plan.
Let's keep to it.

466
00:31:55,407 --> 00:31:59,525
Only innocent people
can afford long-term plans.

467
00:31:59,687 --> 00:32:02,997
Well. I think of myself as innocent,
don't you?

468
00:32:03,167 --> 00:32:06,125
- Are you innocent of adultery?.
- What?.

469
00:32:06,287 --> 00:32:08,437
Of unbridled promiscuity?.

470
00:32:09,487 --> 00:32:11,523
Of taking bribes?

471
00:32:11,687 --> 00:32:13,643
Of judicial murder?.

472
00:32:13,927 --> 00:32:16,600
- Gaius, what...?
- We are guilty!

473
00:32:17,687 --> 00:32:22,044
Stop deluding yourself with these
childish notions. We are guilty.

474
00:32:22,207 --> 00:32:24,846
And I don't care. I love you.

475
00:32:25,007 --> 00:32:29,922
You are everything to me.
But guilt needs daring. Look at me!

476
00:32:30,207 --> 00:32:34,803
I am ready to marry you and adopt
your children, to be at your side.

477
00:32:34,967 --> 00:32:38,437
Your power will remain undiminished.

478
00:32:38,607 --> 00:32:42,646
But we will never have any peace
of mind until we end this farce!

479
00:32:44,447 --> 00:32:47,439
And if we marry - what then?

480
00:32:48,567 --> 00:32:52,037
We have friends - powerful friends.

481
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:56,880
They share our danger and they
look to us for peace of mind.

482
00:32:58,207 --> 00:33:00,641
If we marry, openly and publicly,

483
00:33:00,807 --> 00:33:03,765
all Rome will see
how Claudius is abandoned.

484
00:33:04,367 --> 00:33:07,677
All Rome will see the contempt
in which you hold him.

485
00:33:07,847 --> 00:33:11,123
We'll declare a Republic
and people will flock to our cause.

486
00:33:12,447 --> 00:33:14,278
- When?
- Tomorrow.

487
00:33:14,447 --> 00:33:17,723
Tomorrow I go with him to Ostia
to examine the new harbour.

488
00:33:17,887 --> 00:33:19,878
When you return, then?

489
00:33:20,247 --> 00:33:23,239
No. Tomorrow.

490
00:33:23,927 --> 00:33:25,918
Let him go on his own.

491
00:33:26,687 --> 00:33:29,645
I'll have a headache.
He's used to my headaches.

492
00:33:30,607 --> 00:33:34,316
While he dallies in Ostia,
we'll marry in Rome.

493
00:33:34,487 --> 00:33:38,366
By the time he returns to the city,
it'll belong to us!

494
00:33:39,687 --> 00:33:41,598
I went down to Ostia.

495
00:33:41,767 --> 00:33:46,124
She was supposed to come with me
but she had one of her headache s

496
00:33:46,287 --> 00:33:50,121
I was disappointed, but it was
too late to change my plans

497
00:33:50,647 --> 00:33:54,560
By the time I arrived in Ostia
they were already married.

498
00:34:08,287 --> 00:34:10,357
it will seem incredible I know,

499
00:34:10,527 --> 00:34:13,644
that in a city where nothing
escapes notice or comment,

500
00:34:13,807 --> 00:34:17,800
they could have felt themselves
so secure. And yet, they did.

501
00:34:17,967 --> 00:34:22,119
And I was, perhaps, the only man
in Rome who knew nothing of it

502
00:34:23,407 --> 00:34:25,682
Scandalous! It's scandalous!

503
00:34:26,767 --> 00:34:30,362
While all of Rome trooped
into her bed, we said nothing.

504
00:34:30,527 --> 00:34:32,563
We closed our ayes and said nothing.

505
00:34:32,727 --> 00:34:36,640
But this is utterly
and unbearably different. This...

506
00:34:40,367 --> 00:34:42,756
This puts the Emperor's life
in danger.

507
00:34:42,927 --> 00:34:46,317
And if it puts his life
in danger, it puts ours.

508
00:34:46,487 --> 00:34:48,796
That's a very different
bowl of fish.

509
00:34:48,967 --> 00:34:50,958
Has she divorced him or not?.

510
00:34:51,127 --> 00:34:54,483
She sent a freedman
with her declaration to his chamber.

511
00:34:54,647 --> 00:34:57,525
- But the Emperor wasn't here.
- She knew that!

512
00:34:57,687 --> 00:34:59,917
Is the marriage bigamous or not?.

513
00:35:00,087 --> 00:35:02,043
Do you think she cares?!

514
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:06,596
Don't you see? The marriage
is a public declaration

515
00:35:06,767 --> 00:35:09,122
that the Emperor's wife
has abandoned him

516
00:35:09,287 --> 00:35:12,962
as being too old, too corrupt
and too stupid to govern Rome.

517
00:35:13,127 --> 00:35:16,563
That she has chosen the Consul-Elect
as her husband

518
00:35:16,727 --> 00:35:20,083
is a clear indication
and an invitation to the Senate

519
00:35:20,247 --> 00:35:22,158
to restore the Republic.

520
00:35:22,327 --> 00:35:26,161
In view of Messalina's known
viciousness in getting her own way,

521
00:35:26,327 --> 00:35:30,206
the Senate will put them both
at the head of it!

522
00:35:37,207 --> 00:35:38,606
Well..

523
00:35:40,087 --> 00:35:43,602
he must be told.
This time he must be told.

524
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:48,682
But how?. He won't believe
a word said against her.

525
00:35:49,807 --> 00:35:54,437
From the moment we tell him,
time is on her side, not ours.

526
00:35:55,447 --> 00:35:59,235
Then from the moment we tell him,
we must keep her away from him.

527
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:03,559
We must ensure she never sees him.
Eliminate her without a hearing.

528
00:36:03,727 --> 00:36:07,037
Yes, that's taken for granted.
But how do we tell him?

529
00:36:07,927 --> 00:36:10,157
Whom will he most readily believe?

530
00:36:14,887 --> 00:36:20,359
There is someone. Someone he trusts
who's been his friend for years.

531
00:36:20,527 --> 00:36:23,121
The little prostitute, Calpurnia.

532
00:36:26,527 --> 00:36:30,076
Oh, Calpurnia. Now, what is this?

533
00:36:30,247 --> 00:36:32,522
A note thrust into my hands?

534
00:36:32,687 --> 00:36:35,485
"Grave danger to Rome.
Come to my house."

535
00:36:35,647 --> 00:36:39,356
Well. I hope this isn't
some silly girlish prank.

536
00:36:39,527 --> 00:36:41,438
You've quite alarmed me.

537
00:36:41,607 --> 00:36:44,963
Especially as the ram I was
sacrificing in the temple

538
00:36:45,127 --> 00:36:49,120
turned out to be the most
unpropitious b-beast I'd ever seen.

539
00:36:49,287 --> 00:36:51,403
Its entrails were awful

540
00:36:53,807 --> 00:36:57,038
Why are you trembling?
Now, what's the matter?.

541
00:36:57,207 --> 00:36:59,596
- Oh, Caesar!
- What's the matter?.

542
00:36:59,767 --> 00:37:03,123
Calpurnia, get up!
You know I hate people grovelling.

543
00:37:03,607 --> 00:37:05,245
Oh, Caesar.

544
00:37:05,407 --> 00:37:08,717
Will you please tell me
what you have to say?.

545
00:37:10,327 --> 00:37:13,364
I shall tell you
because nobody else dare tell you,

546
00:37:13,527 --> 00:37:16,166
but when I do you will have me
tortured and flogged.

547
00:37:16,327 --> 00:37:19,683
Calpurnia, dear as you are,
you're making me angry.

548
00:37:20,927 --> 00:37:23,043
Do you still trust me?

549
00:37:23,207 --> 00:37:25,596
In my life, I've trust three women -

550
00:37:25,767 --> 00:37:28,520
my mother, Messalina and yourself.

551
00:37:28,687 --> 00:37:31,406
Why must you include your wife
in that list?. !

552
00:37:31,567 --> 00:37:34,525
Messalina? I trust her with my life.

553
00:37:36,447 --> 00:37:38,517
She has just married Gaius Silius

554
00:37:38,687 --> 00:37:42,123
and the wedding party
is still going on in Rome!

555
00:37:43,207 --> 00:37:46,961
Are you mad, or wicked or both?

556
00:37:47,127 --> 00:37:51,166
They’re married. Your wife
and Silius. Everyone in Rome knows!

557
00:37:51,327 --> 00:37:53,795
But I left her in bed
with a headache.

558
00:37:53,967 --> 00:37:58,119
Now she's in bed with Silius!
Don't you understand? He's her lover!

559
00:37:59,367 --> 00:38:01,323
I thought you knew.

560
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:03,796
Everyone assumed you knew.

561
00:38:03,967 --> 00:38:08,006
Else why have you slept apart
all this time?

562
00:38:11,727 --> 00:38:15,686
I wouldn't have told you even now,
but they’re married.

563
00:38:15,847 --> 00:38:17,803
And I've seen the wedding party.

564
00:38:17,967 --> 00:38:19,844
How?. You haven't been to Rome!

565
00:38:20,007 --> 00:38:21,440
Yes, I've been.

566
00:38:21,607 --> 00:38:25,122
Narcissus came and fetched me.
I've been to Rome today.

567
00:38:25,287 --> 00:38:29,326
The garden of the palace is
decorated with vine leaves and ivy

568
00:38:29,487 --> 00:38:33,480
and bunches of grapes,
wine vats and presses.

569
00:38:33,647 --> 00:38:37,560
They’re all dancing about
like wine-soaked gods!

570
00:38:37,727 --> 00:38:41,163
I don't believe you!
I refuse to believe you!

571
00:38:41,327 --> 00:38:43,124
(SHE SOBS)

572
00:38:43,287 --> 00:38:45,084
(MAN) It's true, Caesar.

573
00:38:48,327 --> 00:38:50,363
Every word she says is true.

574
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:58,159
Caesar, how else
could you have been told?

575
00:38:58,327 --> 00:39:00,636
When have you been prepared...?

576
00:39:01,367 --> 00:39:05,440
When have you listened to any
criticism of your wife's excesses?

577
00:39:05,607 --> 00:39:08,405
Excesses?!
What are you talking about?. !

578
00:39:08,567 --> 00:39:09,966
Caesar...

579
00:39:10,127 --> 00:39:14,723
her adulteries are as numberless
as the sands on the shore.

580
00:39:14,887 --> 00:39:16,957
And that is no figure of speech!

581
00:39:17,447 --> 00:39:22,316
When you were away in Britain,
she competed with a prostitute

582
00:39:22,487 --> 00:39:25,718
to see who could wear out
the most lovers in a day.

583
00:39:25,887 --> 00:39:27,878
Half of Rome saw it!

584
00:39:28,047 --> 00:39:31,164
If you've any doubt about Silius,
go to his house.

585
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:33,124
It will seem like home to you.

586
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:37,963
Your expensive furniture is there -
paintings, tapestries, statues.

587
00:39:38,127 --> 00:39:40,038
Even Imperial slaves.

588
00:39:41,607 --> 00:39:43,518
But that is nothing.

589
00:39:46,887 --> 00:39:49,845
Do you know you are divorced?

590
00:39:50,007 --> 00:39:53,761
Nation and Senate have witnessed
her wedding to Silius.

591
00:39:55,247 --> 00:39:58,683
Act now, or her new husband
controls Rome.

592
00:40:00,967 --> 00:40:02,958
I can't believe it.

593
00:40:10,967 --> 00:40:13,162
My dear, you must.

594
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:17,525
And you must act quickly or you'll
be condemning us all to death.

595
00:40:17,687 --> 00:40:22,078
She's right, Caesar. We must return
to Rome and arrest them at once.

596
00:40:22,247 --> 00:40:25,876
But am I s-still Emperor?.

597
00:40:26,047 --> 00:40:28,800
Some officers of the guard
may have been seduced,

598
00:40:28,967 --> 00:40:31,845
but the soldiers are devoted to you,
I'm certain.

599
00:40:39,207 --> 00:40:41,084
Yes. Arrest them.

600
00:40:41,887 --> 00:40:44,959
Hurry back to Rome
and arrest them all

601
00:40:47,567 --> 00:40:50,798
(NOISY MUSIC AND CHATTER)

602
00:41:45,087 --> 00:41:47,078
- Mnester?.
- Yes?

603
00:41:47,247 --> 00:41:51,559
- What do you see?
- A cloud in the shape of Claudius,

604
00:41:51,727 --> 00:41:53,445
rising over Ostia.

605
00:41:53,607 --> 00:41:55,643
- Is he drifting this way?.
- He was.

606
00:41:55,807 --> 00:41:58,605
But he just farted
and blew himself out to sea.

607
00:42:00,327 --> 00:42:02,283
Out of the way!

608
00:42:02,447 --> 00:42:04,244
Gaius, help me up.

609
00:42:06,887 --> 00:42:08,684
What do you see now?.

610
00:42:08,847 --> 00:42:11,645
A troop of guards climbing the hill

611
00:42:11,807 --> 00:42:15,038
Splendid! Wave them in
and give them wine.

612
00:42:16,927 --> 00:42:19,236
I think not, Gaius Silius.

613
00:42:19,407 --> 00:42:21,557
Their swords are drawn - every one.

614
00:42:21,727 --> 00:42:24,446
The guards! The guards!

615
00:42:24,607 --> 00:42:26,359
The guards are coming!

616
00:42:26,527 --> 00:42:29,883
The guards are coming to arrest us!

617
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:32,083
The Emperor's in Rome!

618
00:42:32,247 --> 00:42:36,081
They’re arresting everybody!
Run! Run!

619
00:42:42,127 --> 00:42:44,197
- Where is the Emperor?.
- In his study.

620
00:42:44,367 --> 00:42:48,838
We've arrested nearly 200 people.
Lady Messalina has not been found.

621
00:42:49,007 --> 00:42:53,637
She is not to be allowed to see
the Emperor without first consulting me.

622
00:43:04,047 --> 00:43:07,596
Where is he? Where is my husband?

623
00:43:11,127 --> 00:43:13,118
He doesn't wish to see you.

624
00:43:21,487 --> 00:43:23,603
Out of my way, you Greek!

625
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:26,235
You dare stand between me
and my husband?

626
00:43:26,407 --> 00:43:29,001
Which husband, you whore? Which one?

627
00:43:29,167 --> 00:43:31,840
Out of my way! Get out of my way!

628
00:43:32,007 --> 00:43:35,079
- Let me go! Let me go!
- Get her out of here!

629
00:43:42,767 --> 00:43:46,362
Let me see him! Claudius!

630
00:43:46,527 --> 00:43:48,085
How dare you stop her!

631
00:43:48,247 --> 00:43:51,364
She is the Emperor's wife
and the mother of his children.

632
00:43:51,527 --> 00:43:53,483
But is he the father?.

633
00:43:54,647 --> 00:43:56,717
Who knows whose litter they are.

634
00:43:57,127 --> 00:43:59,641
Liar! Liar!

635
00:43:59,807 --> 00:44:03,686
Here's a list of your adulteries.
Do you want to read it?. Hundreds!

636
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:08,797
And you call her a mother?.

637
00:44:11,807 --> 00:44:13,479
Take her home and let her wait.

638
00:44:13,647 --> 00:44:15,717
No!

639
00:44:15,887 --> 00:44:18,685
No! Mother!

640
00:44:18,847 --> 00:44:20,883
Claudius!

641
00:44:21,047 --> 00:44:23,322
Claudius!

642
00:44:26,087 --> 00:44:28,726
Arrests have been made
all over the city.

643
00:44:28,887 --> 00:44:33,324
Silius has been taken. Thank heaven
most of the guard proved loyal

644
00:44:34,007 --> 00:44:35,838
Poor woman.

645
00:44:37,047 --> 00:44:40,881
Whatever made her d-do such things?

646
00:44:42,407 --> 00:44:44,921
How unhappy she must have b-been.

647
00:44:51,127 --> 00:44:53,197
You must sign these, Caesar.

648
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:58,165
They’re the charge sheets.
They need your signature urgently.

649
00:45:22,807 --> 00:45:27,164
Sleep, Caesar, sleep.
You need your rest.

650
00:45:28,807 --> 00:45:30,798
Save yourself for Rome.

651
00:45:34,207 --> 00:45:38,883
Geta. Here's the warrant
for her execution. Hurry.

652
00:45:39,567 --> 00:45:43,116
- And offer her the dagger first.
- No.

653
00:45:43,287 --> 00:45:45,278
If she takes her own life,

654
00:45:45,447 --> 00:45:49,156
it will save us having to show him
the warrant in the morning.

655
00:45:53,887 --> 00:45:57,163
Take it to the palace.
Tell no one that you have it.

656
00:45:57,327 --> 00:46:00,364
Only that you want
to see your father. Hurry.

657
00:46:00,527 --> 00:46:04,805
When he reads it,
he'll forgive your mother, you'll see.

658
00:46:06,087 --> 00:46:08,203
Hurry. Hurry.

659
00:46:24,367 --> 00:46:27,518
He must see me, he must.

660
00:46:28,087 --> 00:46:31,716
Oh, how could you, child?
How could you?

661
00:46:33,047 --> 00:46:35,038
Is that all you can say?.

662
00:46:38,247 --> 00:46:40,841
Why don't you do something?

663
00:46:48,247 --> 00:46:50,317
Why don't you see him on your own?

664
00:46:50,487 --> 00:46:52,045
(DOOR CLINKS)

665
00:46:52,207 --> 00:46:53,879
He's coming.

666
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:57,564
He's coming to see me.

667
00:46:58,567 --> 00:47:00,444
(KNOCKING)

668
00:47:04,647 --> 00:47:06,524
What do you want?.

669
00:47:06,687 --> 00:47:09,281
Your life, Lady.
Your husband's orders.

670
00:47:11,127 --> 00:47:12,446
No!

671
00:47:13,327 --> 00:47:19,596
- He wouldn't do that. My husband...
- Read it! It has his signature.

672
00:47:28,927 --> 00:47:31,760
I'm to offer you the dagger first,
if you'll have it.

673
00:47:31,927 --> 00:47:35,886
And then to cut off your pretty head
and put it on a spear.

674
00:47:37,967 --> 00:47:39,286
No!

675
00:47:41,847 --> 00:47:43,246
No!

676
00:47:43,567 --> 00:47:47,276
Not my head! Not my head!

677
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:49,836
Child, child!

678
00:47:50,567 --> 00:47:52,558
Your life is done.

679
00:47:53,527 --> 00:47:56,041
Take the dagger and use it.

680
00:47:58,967 --> 00:48:01,162
Don't let them take my head.

681
00:48:03,047 --> 00:48:04,446
No!

682
00:48:18,487 --> 00:48:20,000
Oh...

683
00:48:20,967 --> 00:48:22,605
No.

684
00:48:25,327 --> 00:48:27,238
He wouldn't do that.

685
00:48:29,327 --> 00:48:30,885
Not Claudius.

686
00:48:32,127 --> 00:48:34,880
Use it. Use it quickly.

687
00:48:43,407 --> 00:48:47,525
I can't. I can't.

688
00:48:50,767 --> 00:48:53,361
Not my head! Not my...!

689
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:16,326
I'll see my w=wife now.

690
00:49:19,447 --> 00:49:25,204
She was executed last night
at your orders, Caesar.

691
00:49:26,407 --> 00:49:28,284
Here is the warrant.

692
00:49:40,327 --> 00:49:43,080
There is a despatch from Britain,
Caesar.

693
00:49:43,247 --> 00:49:47,525
The temple that was to be dedicated
to the God Augustus in Colchester

694
00:49:47,687 --> 00:49:49,598
has been dedicated instead to you.

695
00:49:49,767 --> 00:49:52,486
Augustus means nothing
to the Britons,

696
00:49:52,647 --> 00:49:55,525
but they’re more than happy
to worship you as a god.

697
00:49:55,687 --> 00:49:59,043
Aulus Plautius regrets
having not first consulted you,

698
00:49:59,207 --> 00:50:03,837
but feels sure that you understand
that it was politically correct.

699
00:50:05,847 --> 00:50:10,967
The temple is known
as the Temple of the God Claudius.
