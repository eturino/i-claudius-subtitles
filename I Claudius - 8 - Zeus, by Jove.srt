1
00:00:52,367 --> 00:00:54,358
I found it in that box.

2
00:00:55,487 --> 00:00:57,000
In there.

3
00:00:57,727 --> 00:01:01,436
The box was in my nephew Caligula's
bedroom.

4
00:01:02,727 --> 00:01:05,685
This once belonged to his father,
Germanicus.

5
00:01:07,287 --> 00:01:10,836
I said I would tell everything,
and I shall

6
00:01:11,647 --> 00:01:14,923
I shall hide nothing. Nothing!

7
00:01:15,807 --> 00:01:19,595
And if what comes next
may seem incredible...

8
00:01:20,607 --> 00:01:22,279
believe it.

9
00:01:23,047 --> 00:01:24,844
Believe it!

10
00:01:28,807 --> 00:01:33,278
Of the last five years of Tiberius’ reign,
the less said the better.

11
00:01:33,447 --> 00:01:37,201
He remained at Capri,
entirely given up to whisperers ones,

12
00:01:37,367 --> 00:01:41,679
until at last, when people
began to think he would never die,

13
00:01:41,847 --> 00:01:43,917
he suffered a massive stroke.

14
00:01:44,087 --> 00:01:47,124
He had named Caligula
his principal heir

15
00:01:47,287 --> 00:01:50,836
and Gemellus, who was
his grandson and still a boy,,

16
00:01:51,007 --> 00:01:55,046
his second heir, in case
Caligula should die before him.

17
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:07,476
- He's dead.
- Really?.

18
00:02:09,727 --> 00:02:11,604
Get me his ring.

19
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:32,480
Let us tell the world
that the world has a new Emperor.

20
00:02:50,887 --> 00:02:53,879
Senators, gentlemen...

21
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:58,766
our beloved Emperor,
Tiberius Claudius, is dead.

22
00:02:59,767 --> 00:03:04,124
I have left his room having closed
those tired old ayes with this hand.

23
00:03:05,407 --> 00:03:09,446
Before he died, he took
from his finger this ring...

24
00:03:10,007 --> 00:03:12,726
his own seal.
and placed it on my finger.

25
00:03:12,887 --> 00:03:16,436
And he said,
"I die in peace, little Gaius,

26
00:03:16,607 --> 00:03:19,280
"knowing that you rule in my place."

27
00:03:20,487 --> 00:03:22,842
Those were his last words.

28
00:03:23,807 --> 00:03:27,800
I wept. I feel to my knees and wept.

29
00:03:30,887 --> 00:03:36,723
Gentlemen, I stand before you now
as your Emperor.

30
00:03:36,887 --> 00:03:40,004
- Master!
- Long live Rome!

31
00:03:40,167 --> 00:03:42,397
Master! He's alive again!

32
00:03:43,047 --> 00:03:47,438
He's alive. He's calling for his supper
and he wants his ring back.

33
00:03:52,487 --> 00:03:55,320
- Take it! I don't want it!
- Wait a minute!

34
00:03:55,487 --> 00:03:58,047
Gentlemen, I'm sure
there's been a mistake.

35
00:03:58,207 --> 00:04:02,519
This stupid solve saw the wind
stirring the clothes on the bed.

36
00:04:02,687 --> 00:04:06,680
- No. He's asking for beef cutlets!
- Quiet! I'll make a cutlet of you!

37
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:08,997
He's out of his wits. Can't you see?

38
00:04:09,847 --> 00:04:12,407
You'd better go
and look for yourself.

39
00:04:12,567 --> 00:04:16,879
Exactly. I suggest you all remain here
until the matter's sorted out.

40
00:04:17,047 --> 00:04:18,400
Come on.

41
00:04:26,527 --> 00:04:28,518
I want my supper.

42
00:04:29,367 --> 00:04:32,803
And I want a beef...

43
00:05:08,567 --> 00:05:10,444
I told you he was dead.

44
00:05:10,607 --> 00:05:14,885
Typical! He wanted to see what we'd do
if we thought he was dead.

45
00:05:17,167 --> 00:05:20,955
I shan't forget this, Macro.
I really shan't.

46
00:05:32,807 --> 00:05:37,278
Gentlemen, Tiberius Claudius
is definitely dead.

47
00:05:37,967 --> 00:05:39,798
No question of it.

48
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:43,801
When I entered his room,
he was lying peacefully in his bed.

49
00:05:43,967 --> 00:05:48,597
We shall take the corpse to Rome
and give him a magnificent funeral!

50
00:05:48,767 --> 00:05:51,201
- Hail Caesar!
- Hail Caesar!

51
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,518
Gentlemen!

52
00:05:59,687 --> 00:06:02,838
We are at the dawn
of a new golden age.

53
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:05,441
A son of Germanicus
has come before us.

54
00:06:05,607 --> 00:06:10,237
Let us put ourselves in his hands
and vote him supreme power.

55
00:06:10,407 --> 00:06:15,117
Let us cry, "Rome is saved!"
Hail Caesar!

56
00:06:15,287 --> 00:06:17,039
Hail Caesar!

57
00:06:17,207 --> 00:06:18,959
Hail. Caesar!

58
00:06:21,967 --> 00:06:23,605
Herod Agrippa!

59
00:06:25,127 --> 00:06:26,640
Oh, Herod!

60
00:06:27,447 --> 00:06:31,645
I was wondering the other day
where you were and what you were doing.

61
00:06:31,807 --> 00:06:35,277
If I wasn't trying to borrow money,
I was thinking of you!

62
00:06:35,447 --> 00:06:37,119
Did you arrive together?.

63
00:06:37,287 --> 00:06:40,836
I went straight to Capua.
I knew he was living there.

64
00:06:41,007 --> 00:06:46,127
I found him leaving for Rome
and intending to call on you on his way.

65
00:06:46,887 --> 00:06:49,037
Nothing could have pleased me better.

66
00:06:49,207 --> 00:06:51,926
Sit down. You remember
my grandson, Gemellus?

67
00:06:52,087 --> 00:06:56,603
- He's grown.
- Mmm. He never stops eating.

68
00:06:56,767 --> 00:07:01,363
It's not good for you to eat
all that p-pastry. It clogs the chest.

69
00:07:01,527 --> 00:07:03,358
If I'm scolded, I'll go inside.

70
00:07:03,527 --> 00:07:06,803
He's given himself such airs
since Tiberius died.

71
00:07:06,967 --> 00:07:09,435
- He thinks he already rules.
- I do.

72
00:07:09,607 --> 00:07:11,643
I was made ruler with Caligula.

73
00:07:11,807 --> 00:07:15,322
Quiet! The Senate have set
that aside. You're much too young.

74
00:07:15,487 --> 00:07:19,036
People are not made emperors
to have the run of baker's shops.

75
00:07:19,207 --> 00:07:22,677
I can't see it's any worse
to eat too much pastry

76
00:07:22,847 --> 00:07:24,917
than it is to drink too much wine.

77
00:07:26,447 --> 00:07:28,836
And a lot of grown-ups do that.

78
00:07:31,127 --> 00:07:35,996
He eats for comfort. Livilla ignored him.
She had other interests.

79
00:07:36,167 --> 00:07:38,442
- I wrote to you about Livilla.
- Yes.

80
00:07:38,607 --> 00:07:42,600
Let's not talk of it. She's dead,
and at my hands. I'd do it again.

81
00:07:43,847 --> 00:07:48,079
Well. perhaps things will improve
now that Caligula is in command.

82
00:07:48,247 --> 00:07:49,646
Let's hope so.

83
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:53,800
I like all the titles you have for me,
as does my sister, Drusilla.

84
00:07:53,967 --> 00:07:56,117
I shall probably use them all

85
00:07:56,727 --> 00:07:58,877
What about the Consulship, Lentulus?

86
00:07:59,047 --> 00:08:02,801
Your term is up. Have you chosen
the Consul for the next term?

87
00:08:02,967 --> 00:08:05,003
The choice is obvious to us.

88
00:08:05,167 --> 00:08:07,920
The Senate begs you
to accept the next term

89
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:10,521
and to choose a colleague
to share it.

90
00:08:10,687 --> 00:08:12,439
Accepted.

91
00:08:13,527 --> 00:08:16,280
I hereby proclaim
that my first act as Consul

92
00:08:16,447 --> 00:08:20,042
will be to collect all criminal
dossiers collected by Sejanus

93
00:08:20,207 --> 00:08:22,596
and have them burnt
in the marketplace!

94
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:28,005
And, in memory of my dear mother,
Agrippina,

95
00:08:28,167 --> 00:08:32,160
there will be a new annual festival
of horse racing and sword fighting.

96
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:39,999
In future, September will be known
as "Germanicus" after my father,

97
00:08:40,167 --> 00:08:44,160
as August was after my great...
my great grandfather.

98
00:08:46,807 --> 00:08:50,117
And now I have a headache.
This audience is at an end.

99
00:08:50,647 --> 00:08:53,320
- Is your head bad again?
- Yes.

100
00:08:53,487 --> 00:08:56,126
Come to my room
and I'll soothe it for you.

101
00:09:01,887 --> 00:09:03,240
Lentulus...

102
00:09:03,407 --> 00:09:07,195
here is my chosen colleague
to share the Consulship with me.

103
00:09:07,367 --> 00:09:11,838
- Gemellus. An excellent choice.
- No, no! Not Gemellus. Not him.

104
00:09:12,687 --> 00:09:16,316
- My Uncle Claudius.
- Your Uncle Claudius?

105
00:09:16,487 --> 00:09:19,923
Who else should share it
but my father's beloved brother?.

106
00:09:20,807 --> 00:09:25,164
Uncle, I appoint you my colleague
as Consul for the first term.

107
00:09:25,327 --> 00:09:28,763
- M-m-me? A C-Consul?.
- Yes. We'll rule together.

108
00:09:28,927 --> 00:09:32,237
B-but I've forgotten all the r-rules
and p-procedures.

109
00:09:32,407 --> 00:09:35,399
I'll think of everything
and you can do everything.

110
00:09:35,567 --> 00:09:36,886
B-b-b...

111
00:09:37,047 --> 00:09:41,040
Uncle, there's a galloping in my head
and you're making it worse!

112
00:09:42,487 --> 00:09:44,318
The matter is closed.

113
00:09:46,807 --> 00:09:49,560
- What is the matter with him?
- The matter?.

114
00:09:49,727 --> 00:09:53,800
- He keeps clearing his throat.
- He's had a v-very bad cough.

115
00:09:53,967 --> 00:09:57,039
Can't he get rid of it?.
It's very irritating.

116
00:09:57,207 --> 00:09:59,596
Well. he's taking a cough mixture.

117
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:02,358
Oh. I see.

118
00:10:02,527 --> 00:10:04,518
Well. let's hope it clears up soon.

119
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,598
I have a weak chest.
It's not my fault.

120
00:10:06,767 --> 00:10:08,803
No. But it's your chest!

121
00:10:13,407 --> 00:10:15,363
Is that your own hair?.

122
00:10:16,247 --> 00:10:19,125
- Pardon?
- Is it your own hair or a wig?

123
00:10:20,647 --> 00:10:22,126
M-my own.

124
00:10:22,287 --> 00:10:25,518
Why have you got so much?
I find that extremely irritating.

125
00:10:25,687 --> 00:10:27,484
You're much older than I am.

126
00:10:28,567 --> 00:10:32,116
Uncle, I've arranged a suite
of rooms for you in the palace.

127
00:10:32,287 --> 00:10:36,166
You can come and live with me
and my sisters. You'll like that.

128
00:10:36,327 --> 00:10:38,716
The whole family will be together.

129
00:10:38,887 --> 00:10:40,878
I'm very fond of my family...

130
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:43,204
generally speaking.

131
00:10:45,127 --> 00:10:48,597
Uncle, your first official duty
as Consul will be to have...

132
00:10:49,247 --> 00:10:52,956
two statues made of my late
brothers, Drusus and Nero.

133
00:10:53,127 --> 00:10:56,722
They’ll be set up and consecrated
in the marketplace.

134
00:10:56,887 --> 00:10:59,685
The ceremony will take place
in early December.

135
00:10:59,847 --> 00:11:04,159
I know it'll cost a great deal of money,
but there's plenty of money.

136
00:11:04,327 --> 00:11:07,364
Tiberius left 27 million
gold pieces.

137
00:11:07,527 --> 00:11:10,644
M-may I ask how much is l-left?.

138
00:11:11,567 --> 00:11:14,400
Lentulus, how much is left?.

139
00:11:16,087 --> 00:11:18,203
Between eight and nine, Caesar.

140
00:11:19,367 --> 00:11:22,279
- Is that all?.
- He left a lot of debts.

141
00:11:23,047 --> 00:11:27,245
That goody skinflint! He owed money
and left me to pay for it all!

142
00:11:27,407 --> 00:11:30,205
I should have killed him
when I had the chance!

143
00:11:32,207 --> 00:11:34,721
Oh, my headache's getting worse.

144
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:37,921
Galloping inside it.
Pounding of hooves.

145
00:11:38,087 --> 00:11:41,602
- Come to my room.
- It's in my head.

146
00:11:58,687 --> 00:12:00,405
What was I saying?

147
00:12:00,567 --> 00:12:03,798
You should have k-killed him
when you had the chance.

148
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:07,323
Yes. Many times I had the chance
and thought of doing it.

149
00:12:07,487 --> 00:12:09,717
Shall I take G-Gemellus to his room?

150
00:12:09,887 --> 00:12:12,924
No. I'm about to tell you a story.
Let him hear.

151
00:12:13,087 --> 00:12:16,477
This will become, I'm sure,
an historic anecdote.

152
00:12:16,647 --> 00:12:18,842
I want you to write it down later,
Uncle.

153
00:12:19,007 --> 00:12:21,726
- Will you stop coughing?!
- It's very difficult.

154
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,240
Well. try!

155
00:12:30,487 --> 00:12:33,285
Lentulus, how much is left?.

156
00:12:33,527 --> 00:12:35,040
Of what?.

157
00:12:35,647 --> 00:12:37,444
Of Tiberius' fortune.

158
00:12:38,327 --> 00:12:40,716
Between eight and nine million,
Caesar.

159
00:12:40,887 --> 00:12:43,959
- Is that all?.
- He also left a lot of debts.

160
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:51,006
We've had this conversation before,
what's the matter with you?

161
00:12:56,927 --> 00:13:01,318
I know what I was about to say.
I was going to tell you a story.

162
00:13:02,727 --> 00:13:05,560
It happened three, four years ago
in Capri

163
00:13:05,727 --> 00:13:08,480
when I was nothing
but an innocent young boy,

164
00:13:08,647 --> 00:13:12,765
shocked and shamed by the depravity
to which the Emperor had fallen.

165
00:13:14,007 --> 00:13:17,636
More and more,
in my precocious wisdom,

166
00:13:18,367 --> 00:13:23,282
I realised that the fate of Rome
might rely on a single knife stroke.

167
00:13:23,447 --> 00:13:26,757
A knife in my hand.

168
00:13:27,647 --> 00:13:29,763
And the thought tormented me.

169
00:13:29,927 --> 00:13:32,760
I began to see it
as my inescapable destiny.

170
00:13:32,927 --> 00:13:35,157
"But why me?" I said.

171
00:13:35,327 --> 00:13:39,400
"Why me, who never had a single
violent thought in his life?

172
00:13:39,567 --> 00:13:44,357
"Why should this onerous duty
be thrust upon me?"

173
00:13:46,487 --> 00:13:53,040
Yet, one night,
sleepless as usual with grief

174
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:56,756
at the fate of my dear mother
and my dear brothers...

175
00:13:58,367 --> 00:14:01,564
I decided, come what might...

176
00:14:03,167 --> 00:14:07,957
that I would be avenged, at last,
upon their murderer.

177
00:14:10,047 --> 00:14:13,483
So I took a knife that belonged
to my father, Germanicus,

178
00:14:13,647 --> 00:14:17,765
and I went into the Emperor's room
where he lay tossing and groaning

179
00:14:17,927 --> 00:14:19,883
in a nightmare of guilt.

180
00:14:20,047 --> 00:14:23,084
There was a galloping in my head
and a pounding...

181
00:14:24,527 --> 00:14:26,882
Yes. Yes, I remember.

182
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:30,076
That was the first time I heard it.

183
00:14:30,967 --> 00:14:34,243
I lifted the dagger
in order to strike...

184
00:14:35,487 --> 00:14:38,445
when a divine voice
sounded in my ear.

185
00:14:38,607 --> 00:14:40,802
"Great grandson, stop!

186
00:14:40,967 --> 00:14:44,277
"Hold your hand.
To kill him would be impious!"

187
00:14:47,327 --> 00:14:49,045
I froze.

188
00:14:49,807 --> 00:14:53,766
I turned to see if I could find
the owner of the voice,

189
00:14:53,927 --> 00:14:56,964
but there was no one there
besides the Emperor and myself.

190
00:14:57,127 --> 00:15:00,915
And yet I felt the presence
of the Divine Augustus.

191
00:15:01,607 --> 00:15:04,679
"Oh, God Augustus!" I cried.

192
00:15:05,647 --> 00:15:09,606
"He killed my mother and my brothers,
your descendants.

193
00:15:09,767 --> 00:15:11,723
"Should I not avenge them

194
00:15:11,887 --> 00:15:16,517
"even at the risk of being shunned
by all men as a parricide?"

195
00:15:22,567 --> 00:15:24,797
Augustus answered.

196
00:15:27,007 --> 00:15:32,718
"Oh, magnanimous son,
who art to be Emperor hereafter,

197
00:15:32,887 --> 00:15:35,355
"there is no need to do
what you would do.

198
00:15:35,527 --> 00:15:36,721
"By my orders,

199
00:15:36,887 --> 00:15:40,596
"the Furies nightly avenge
your dear ones while he sleeps.

200
00:15:40,767 --> 00:15:42,120
(HOOFBEATS)

201
00:15:42,287 --> 00:15:46,166
"Leave them to their work and him
to the torments of his dreams

202
00:15:46,327 --> 00:15:49,364
"and the torments to come
in the hereafter.

203
00:15:50,887 --> 00:15:54,163
"He will suffer eternal agonies,
I swear,

204
00:15:54,327 --> 00:15:57,603
"while you...while you, my son...

205
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:04,439
"while...after a glorious reign...

206
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:07,121
"will enter the bosom of Augustus."

207
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:10,756
I threw the dagger aside.

208
00:16:12,367 --> 00:16:15,279
Father! Father!

209
00:16:15,447 --> 00:16:17,085
(HOOFBEATS)

210
00:16:17,247 --> 00:16:19,158
Help me!

211
00:16:20,487 --> 00:16:21,886
Help me!

212
00:16:23,207 --> 00:16:24,925
Stop it!

213
00:16:25,807 --> 00:16:28,002
STOP IT!

214
00:16:29,727 --> 00:16:31,046
Stop it!

215
00:16:31,207 --> 00:16:33,516
Stop it! Stop!

216
00:16:40,047 --> 00:16:42,800
The statues must be ready
by the end of N-November.

217
00:16:42,967 --> 00:16:45,800
- I said I'd do my best...
- I can take the work elsewhere!

218
00:16:45,967 --> 00:16:48,276
You'd lose time.
We've already started.

219
00:16:48,447 --> 00:16:52,725
- You haven't started them!
- I promise we'll start tomorrow.

220
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:56,197
The way the Emperor is,
he won't be ready for the ceremony.

221
00:16:56,367 --> 00:16:59,200
Never mind the Emperor,
that's his business.

222
00:16:59,367 --> 00:17:02,165
You just make sure those statues
are r-ready!

223
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:34,205
The Emperor awoke this morning,
but then relapsed into a coma.

224
00:17:34,367 --> 00:17:36,358
That's all I can tell you.

225
00:17:36,527 --> 00:17:39,121
I suggest that you return
to your homes.

226
00:17:39,287 --> 00:17:42,677
Everything that can be done
is being done.

227
00:17:49,487 --> 00:17:53,002
We pray for him hourly.
Tell him that if he wakes.

228
00:17:53,167 --> 00:17:54,486
I shall

229
00:17:54,647 --> 00:17:58,925
I've offered my own life in place
of his if the gods will spare him.

230
00:17:59,087 --> 00:18:03,444
If anything happens to him, it would
be the worst calamity to befall Rome

231
00:18:03,607 --> 00:18:05,723
since the death of Germanicus.

232
00:18:05,887 --> 00:18:08,276
Your prayers will help him,
I'm sure.

233
00:18:12,287 --> 00:18:16,326
Uncle Claudius, come quickly!
He's awake and he wants to see you.

234
00:18:16,487 --> 00:18:18,159
- What for?.
- I don't know.

235
00:18:18,327 --> 00:18:20,318
For heaven's sake, humour him.

236
00:18:20,487 --> 00:18:23,285
He'll kill you if you don't say
what he wants.

237
00:18:23,447 --> 00:18:25,961
- What does he want me to say?.
- I don't know!

238
00:18:26,127 --> 00:18:28,197
But he just tried to kill me.

239
00:18:28,367 --> 00:18:30,244
He said I didn't love him.

240
00:18:30,407 --> 00:18:35,322
He made me swear over and over again
that I did! Oh, do go, please!

241
00:18:45,047 --> 00:18:46,878
Hail C-Caesar.

242
00:18:47,607 --> 00:18:52,761
What a j-j-joy to see you alive
and to hear your voice again.

243
00:18:53,847 --> 00:18:57,362
D-dare I hope that you're better?.

244
00:18:58,207 --> 00:19:00,243
I've never really been ill

245
00:19:00,727 --> 00:19:02,797
Oh. Really?.

246
00:19:03,407 --> 00:19:07,082
No. I've been undergoing
a metamorphosis.

247
00:19:07,247 --> 00:19:11,525
Oh. Was it p-p-painful?.

248
00:19:12,687 --> 00:19:18,125
It was like a birth in which
the mother delivers herself.

249
00:19:18,287 --> 00:19:19,959
Oh, yes.

250
00:19:20,127 --> 00:19:23,199
Oh, that m-must have been p-painful

251
00:19:24,207 --> 00:19:29,804
M-may I enquire
what is the character

252
00:19:29,967 --> 00:19:36,076
of this g-glorious change
which has come over you?

253
00:19:38,647 --> 00:19:40,478
Isn't it obvious?

254
00:19:47,287 --> 00:19:51,724
Y-you've b-become a g-g-god!

255
00:19:53,127 --> 00:19:55,004
Oh, my god.

256
00:19:55,167 --> 00:19:57,886
Oh, let me worship you!

257
00:19:58,047 --> 00:20:01,403
Oh, how could I have been so blind?!

258
00:20:02,407 --> 00:20:05,558
Well. I am still in mortal disguise.

259
00:20:05,727 --> 00:20:07,718
No, I should have seen it at once.

260
00:20:07,887 --> 00:20:12,836
Your face shines,
even in this light, like a l-lamp.

261
00:20:13,007 --> 00:20:14,360
Does it?.

262
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:17,717
Get me that mirror.

263
00:20:27,767 --> 00:20:30,725
Oh. It is bright, isn't it?.

264
00:20:31,607 --> 00:20:34,440
I could r-read by it.

265
00:20:35,887 --> 00:20:38,196
I always knew
that this would happen.

266
00:20:38,367 --> 00:20:40,676
I always knew I was divine.
Think of it.

267
00:20:40,847 --> 00:20:46,046
When I was two, I put down a mutiny
in my father's army and saved Rome.

268
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:48,038
That was prodigious.

269
00:20:48,207 --> 00:20:51,358
It's like the stories
they tell of M-Mercury as a child,

270
00:20:51,527 --> 00:20:56,078
or Hercules who s-s-strangled snakes
in his cradle.

271
00:20:56,247 --> 00:21:00,081
Exactly. Only Mercury
only stole a few oxen,

272
00:21:00,247 --> 00:21:03,603
whereas by the age of ten,
I'd already killed my father.

273
00:21:04,367 --> 00:21:07,564
- You didn't know that, did you?
- N-n-no...

274
00:21:09,567 --> 00:21:11,080
Divinity.

275
00:21:11,967 --> 00:21:15,482
Even Jove didn't do that.
He merely banished the old man.

276
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:21,040
Why, if you d-don't mind my asking,
d-did you do that?.

277
00:21:21,207 --> 00:21:23,243
Well. he stood in my way.

278
00:21:23,887 --> 00:21:25,923
Me - a young god!

279
00:21:26,087 --> 00:21:30,444
He tried to discipline me.
So I frightened him to death in Antioch.

280
00:21:30,607 --> 00:21:32,757
So it was you who did all that?.

281
00:21:33,367 --> 00:21:35,119
It's incredible.

282
00:21:35,287 --> 00:21:38,836
No, not at all Not for a god.
It was very simple.

283
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:41,475
Not only did I kill
my natural father,

284
00:21:41,647 --> 00:21:46,277
I also killed my adoptive father,
Tiberius. Jove never did that!

285
00:21:46,447 --> 00:21:49,166
No. I've never read
that he did that.

286
00:21:49,327 --> 00:21:51,318
And you're a very well-read man.

287
00:21:51,487 --> 00:21:54,923
And whereas Jove only slept
with one of his sisters,

288
00:21:55,087 --> 00:21:58,875
I've slept with all three of mine -
all had a god in their beds.

289
00:21:59,047 --> 00:22:01,561
Martina told me it was right
for a god.

290
00:22:01,727 --> 00:22:04,480
Oh, you knew Martina well?.

291
00:22:04,647 --> 00:22:07,480
Oh, yes, yes. Very well
A very wise woman.

292
00:22:07,647 --> 00:22:12,675
In Egypt, she taught me about the gods -
especially the Greek ones.

293
00:22:12,847 --> 00:22:15,236
She said that I was
more like Zeus than Jove.

294
00:22:15,407 --> 00:22:18,604
Jove was just a pale
Roman copy of Zeus.

295
00:22:20,567 --> 00:22:23,684
Zeus married his sister, didn't he?

296
00:22:23,847 --> 00:22:26,042
- Yes.
- What was her name?

297
00:22:26,207 --> 00:22:28,562
- Hera.
- Hera. That's it.

298
00:22:28,727 --> 00:22:31,321
And she became pregnant by him.

299
00:22:31,487 --> 00:22:34,047
No. That was Metis.

300
00:22:34,207 --> 00:22:38,200
And fearing that the child would
become stronger than himself

301
00:22:38,367 --> 00:22:40,358
and r-rule the heavens,

302
00:22:40,527 --> 00:22:44,918
he took the child from her body
and swallowed it whole,

303
00:22:45,087 --> 00:22:47,760
and Athena sprang from his head.

304
00:22:48,287 --> 00:22:50,642
Yes, something like that.

305
00:22:51,847 --> 00:22:55,556
I never used to believe that sort
of story but, of course, now...

306
00:22:55,727 --> 00:22:57,763
I can see that they’re true.

307
00:22:59,207 --> 00:23:03,405
Well. now you understand
why I have always been divine.

308
00:23:05,647 --> 00:23:07,683
Drusilla is divine too.

309
00:23:07,847 --> 00:23:11,635
I shall announce it at the same time
I announce my own divinity.

310
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:15,925
Oh, this is the most glorious hour
of my life!

311
00:23:18,007 --> 00:23:22,683
Will you allow me to retire
and s-sacrifice to you at once?

312
00:23:24,047 --> 00:23:28,802
The d-divine air you exhale
is too strong for me.

313
00:23:28,967 --> 00:23:31,003
I'm fainting, D-Divinity.

314
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:39,964
Go in peace.

315
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:43,597
I was thinking of killing you,
but I've changed my mind.

316
00:23:45,527 --> 00:23:47,199
Send Drusilla to me.

317
00:24:01,287 --> 00:24:03,278
He wants to see you.

318
00:24:03,727 --> 00:24:06,878
He's become a god.
Oh, you're a god too.

319
00:24:07,607 --> 00:24:09,165
We're not.

320
00:24:09,567 --> 00:24:11,797
A god? Which one?

321
00:24:11,967 --> 00:24:13,923
He thinks he's Zeus!

322
00:24:14,087 --> 00:24:17,124
- That sounds bad for us mortals.
- Perhaps not.

323
00:24:17,287 --> 00:24:21,246
When he announces his divinity,
they’ll all see he's mad.

324
00:24:21,407 --> 00:24:23,443
We'll have the Republic back.

325
00:24:23,607 --> 00:24:28,556
My friend, this could be the b-best
thing that ever happened to us.

326
00:24:32,007 --> 00:24:33,998
The Emperor is coming.

327
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:39,004
There is something you ought
to know before he arrives,

328
00:24:39,167 --> 00:24:41,806
so you won't be taken totally
by surprise.

329
00:24:43,807 --> 00:24:48,483
We are privileged to be living
during the most astonishing advent.

330
00:24:49,727 --> 00:24:54,323
The Emperor has undergone
a transformation -

331
00:24:54,967 --> 00:24:58,562
a metamorphosis.

332
00:24:59,607 --> 00:25:02,565
He has become a god.

333
00:25:02,727 --> 00:25:04,638
(SOME LAUGHTER)

334
00:25:06,207 --> 00:25:08,846
That is unusual. to say the least.

335
00:25:09,567 --> 00:25:13,242
But that's the nature of miracles -
to be unusual

336
00:25:14,167 --> 00:25:17,398
If it's the nature of some people
not to believe in them...

337
00:25:17,567 --> 00:25:19,717
well. the more fool them.

338
00:25:21,847 --> 00:25:24,759
The Emperor doesn't want
to make too much of it.

339
00:25:24,927 --> 00:25:27,395
He doesn't want
any public announcements.

340
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:30,320
He wants us all to behave normally.

341
00:25:30,887 --> 00:25:36,120
Although he is now a god, he is
still the same lovable young man.

342
00:25:36,287 --> 00:25:38,198
I can attest to that.

343
00:25:38,367 --> 00:25:42,645
And to enable his relationships
to continue as they always were,

344
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:47,835
he has decided, for convenience,
to retain his mortal form.

345
00:25:48,607 --> 00:25:52,646
By the way, his sister Drusilla's
become a goddess. Any questions?

346
00:25:57,327 --> 00:26:02,640
Well. of course, it is unusual.
but, as Sertorius Macro says

347
00:26:02,807 --> 00:26:05,275
that is the nature of miracles.

348
00:26:06,207 --> 00:26:10,120
Why, one must ask oneself,
are gods made only after death?

349
00:26:10,847 --> 00:26:15,443
Sooner or later, a man was bound
to be reborn a god in our very midst.

350
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:19,438
If we worship the Divine Augustus
after his death,

351
00:26:19,607 --> 00:26:23,646
doesn't it make sense to worship
his great-grandson while he's alive?

352
00:26:23,807 --> 00:26:27,800
I think we should count ourselves
fortunate to be living at this time.

353
00:26:27,967 --> 00:26:31,084
Gentlemen, posterity will envy us.

354
00:26:31,487 --> 00:26:34,206
Posterity will call you an ass,
you idiot.

355
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:37,524
The Emperor!

356
00:26:38,567 --> 00:26:41,240
(TRUMPET FANFARE)

357
00:26:53,007 --> 00:26:57,797
My sister and I are pleased
to admit you into our presence again.

358
00:27:01,087 --> 00:27:04,716
- Your recovery is a miracle.
- You prayed for it, Lentulus.

359
00:27:04,887 --> 00:27:08,197
Night and day. But our prayers
are not always heard.

360
00:27:08,367 --> 00:27:10,642
Yes, but yours were very special

361
00:27:10,807 --> 00:27:14,800
You offered your life to the gods
in place of mine. That was noble.

362
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:17,435
It's true. I did.

363
00:27:18,287 --> 00:27:21,438
- What are you going to do about it?.
- Do about it?.

364
00:27:22,087 --> 00:27:23,645
What do you mean?

365
00:27:23,807 --> 00:27:28,198
Well. I'm still here and so are you,
but we oughtn't both to be here.

366
00:27:28,367 --> 00:27:31,598
Should we not give the gods
the things we promise them?

367
00:27:31,767 --> 00:27:34,839
You're in danger of perjury.
Think about it.

368
00:27:35,767 --> 00:27:40,682
But not too long. The gods won't
wait for ever. I know them well

369
00:27:40,847 --> 00:27:45,523
We will walk to the forum and show
ourselves to the people of Rome.

370
00:27:45,687 --> 00:27:48,759
Still coughing?
We must do something about that.

371
00:27:48,927 --> 00:27:51,760
- You haven't forgotten my statues?
- No.

372
00:27:51,927 --> 00:27:55,476
- Herod, you're back.
- To bring you my congratulations.

373
00:27:55,647 --> 00:27:58,684
Come, walk with me a while.
I want to talk to you.

374
00:28:05,567 --> 00:28:09,162
There's no one in all Rome man enough
to strike him down like a dog?!

375
00:28:09,327 --> 00:28:12,444
It's v-very difficult, Mother.
There are always guards.

376
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:15,599
Anyway, I've never killed
anyone before.

377
00:28:15,767 --> 00:28:19,555
Besides, everyone believes
this madness can't last.

378
00:28:19,727 --> 00:28:22,639
Either he'll recover his senses
or he'll die.

379
00:28:22,807 --> 00:28:26,959
- Couldn't you poison his food?
- Mother! What am I, an assassin?

380
00:28:27,127 --> 00:28:30,403
- A living god among us!
- And a goddess.

381
00:28:30,567 --> 00:28:32,444
I saw that coming a long time ago.

382
00:28:32,607 --> 00:28:36,680
To take a sister for a wife!
They will both rot in hell for it.

383
00:28:36,847 --> 00:28:39,964
- I feel sorry for her.
- You would!

384
00:28:40,127 --> 00:28:43,244
She's terrified of him,
so she p-plays up to him!

385
00:28:43,407 --> 00:28:45,921
- I don't blame her.
- I'd kill myself first!

386
00:28:46,087 --> 00:28:48,123
No one wants to die, Mother.

387
00:28:48,287 --> 00:28:52,519
I saw Lentulus' face when it dawned
on him that the god wasn't joking.

388
00:28:52,687 --> 00:28:56,157
He waited hoping Caligula
would forget it, but he didn't.

389
00:28:56,327 --> 00:29:00,479
He sent Macro with some guards
to watch him while he opened his veins.

390
00:29:00,647 --> 00:29:05,516
He got what he deserved!
You're all a pack of shameless cowards!

391
00:29:06,407 --> 00:29:09,797
When Germanicus died,
there died the last of the Romans.

392
00:29:11,247 --> 00:29:13,317
It's good to get away from Rome.

393
00:29:13,487 --> 00:29:16,684
You're fortunate you don't
have to live in the palace.

394
00:29:16,847 --> 00:29:21,284
- What goes on there at night...
- I have heard enough!

395
00:29:23,167 --> 00:29:26,284
- Has he any money left?.
- No, not much.

396
00:29:26,447 --> 00:29:30,679
He gave a charioteer 20,000
gold pieces the other day

397
00:29:30,847 --> 00:29:32,724
just for w=winning a race.

398
00:29:32,887 --> 00:29:35,959
When the money runs out,
you'd all better watch out.

399
00:29:36,127 --> 00:29:38,118
I'll see you both at supper.

400
00:29:41,607 --> 00:29:44,679
- She's very upset.
- Well. what can I do?

401
00:29:45,687 --> 00:29:49,282
I've got a mad nephew,
but I can't kill him.

402
00:29:49,447 --> 00:29:51,358
What's the matter with us, Herod?

403
00:29:51,527 --> 00:29:56,123
These are the children
of Germanicus. How could it happen?

404
00:29:56,847 --> 00:30:00,078
You know what they say
about the tree of the Claudians?

405
00:30:00,247 --> 00:30:03,922
It bears two kinds of fruit -
the sweet and the bad.

406
00:30:04,087 --> 00:30:07,557
They’ve certainly
had a t-terrifying crop this season.

407
00:30:39,647 --> 00:30:42,036
(CALIGULA) This isn't their house.

408
00:30:43,287 --> 00:30:45,323
This is our house.

409
00:30:45,607 --> 00:30:47,165
Yes.

410
00:30:47,327 --> 00:30:49,602
We shall spend
most of our time here.

411
00:30:49,767 --> 00:30:53,077
I'll build a bridge to connect it
to the palace.

412
00:30:53,247 --> 00:30:55,397
I'll hold my audiences here.

413
00:30:55,567 --> 00:30:57,000
Yes!

414
00:31:00,847 --> 00:31:03,281
Look at him. Jove!

415
00:31:03,447 --> 00:31:05,119
(BOTH LAUGH)

416
00:31:05,287 --> 00:31:09,326
- Does he look like a god?
- An inferior god.

417
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:14,876
Yes. An inferior god.

418
00:31:19,647 --> 00:31:21,603
Did you hear that?.

419
00:31:23,207 --> 00:31:25,960
You're not important enough
for this temple.

420
00:31:28,007 --> 00:31:29,725
I beg your pardon?

421
00:31:29,887 --> 00:31:34,517
Be careful what you say to me
or I'll have your face smashed in!

422
00:31:36,767 --> 00:31:38,917
Well. speak up! I can't hear you.

423
00:31:41,847 --> 00:31:46,318
Well. for now you may address me
as Zeus,

424
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:50,321
for in power he is the nearest
who approaches me.

425
00:31:51,847 --> 00:31:55,840
You were created by the old Romans
in his image, but you're nothing.

426
00:31:56,967 --> 00:31:58,958
Nothing, do you hear me?

427
00:31:59,127 --> 00:32:01,960
And this is Hera...

428
00:32:04,327 --> 00:32:09,196
out of whom the Romans created you!

429
00:32:10,687 --> 00:32:13,247
(DRUSILLA) We shall move you both
to an annexe.

430
00:32:14,527 --> 00:32:16,677
You've been here far too long.

431
00:32:17,927 --> 00:32:21,636
This is the temple
in which I have chosen

432
00:32:21,807 --> 00:32:24,321
to bear the child of Zeus!

433
00:32:37,727 --> 00:32:39,240
A child?

434
00:32:43,407 --> 00:32:44,840
Mine?

435
00:32:45,687 --> 00:32:47,678
The child of Zeus.

436
00:32:48,767 --> 00:32:50,644
To rule the universe.

437
00:32:54,247 --> 00:32:55,885
Tell her.

438
00:32:57,447 --> 00:33:01,804
Tell her what it's like
to be loved by Zeus.

439
00:33:02,687 --> 00:33:04,006
Tell her.

440
00:33:04,727 --> 00:33:08,197
It was like the sun bursting
in my veins.

441
00:33:08,367 --> 00:33:10,801
It was like a shooting star!

442
00:33:11,807 --> 00:33:16,562
It was as if all the lights in the universe
blazed at once in my womb!

443
00:33:17,687 --> 00:33:20,520
And a new universe was born.

444
00:33:30,367 --> 00:33:34,076
- But you promised they’d be ready!
- Don't get excited.

445
00:33:34,247 --> 00:33:36,442
I said I'd do my best, that's all

446
00:33:36,607 --> 00:33:39,167
They must be ready
for the ceremony tomorrow.

447
00:33:39,327 --> 00:33:41,761
- Nero's ready.
- One's no good, you idiot!

448
00:33:41,927 --> 00:33:45,681
- There's no need to be offensive.
- I'll have you thrown out of the city!

449
00:33:45,847 --> 00:33:49,840
The marble didn't arrive till last weak
and my best sculptor's sick.

450
00:33:50,007 --> 00:33:53,397
- The marble was here last time!
- It was? There was a crack in it.

451
00:33:53,567 --> 00:33:55,478
You used it for somebody else!

452
00:33:55,647 --> 00:33:58,115
I swear we never used it
for anyone else.

453
00:33:58,287 --> 00:34:01,518
- Take Nero. Drusus will be a weak.
- You can keep it.

454
00:34:01,687 --> 00:34:04,326
You've got me
into a great deal of trouble.

455
00:34:04,487 --> 00:34:08,036
Keep it?. What am I going to do
with a statue of Nero?

456
00:34:08,207 --> 00:34:11,244
You can stick it! And you know
where you can stick it!

457
00:34:11,407 --> 00:34:14,240
I'll see you in the courts
for breach of contract!

458
00:34:14,407 --> 00:34:18,286
You'll sue me? I'll sue you!
I'll sue you for damages.

459
00:34:18,447 --> 00:34:20,961
For misrepresentation. For fraud.

460
00:34:21,127 --> 00:34:23,595
You'll be hearing from my lawyers!

461
00:34:23,767 --> 00:34:26,406
(CRASH!)
I'll charge you for that too!

462
00:34:29,287 --> 00:34:32,484
Caesar, there's something
you should know.

463
00:34:34,607 --> 00:34:37,963
- Can you hear it?.
- Hear what?.

464
00:34:39,047 --> 00:34:41,607
Gemellus coughing.

465
00:34:42,727 --> 00:34:44,797
Can't you hear it?.

466
00:34:45,727 --> 00:34:47,046
N-no.

467
00:34:48,167 --> 00:34:52,160
Oh, what it is to have the senses
of a god. I can hear everything.

468
00:34:52,327 --> 00:34:56,081
Even a leaf falling
on the other side of the world.

469
00:34:56,247 --> 00:34:58,886
Sometimes it's unbearable
to hear so much.

470
00:34:59,807 --> 00:35:01,798
Can't you hear anything?

471
00:35:02,927 --> 00:35:04,679
N-not a thing.

472
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:09,919
He was coughing all the way through
dinner. Why weren't you at dinner?.

473
00:35:10,087 --> 00:35:12,521
I f-fell asleep.

474
00:35:12,687 --> 00:35:15,155
He was coughing all the way
through dinner.

475
00:35:15,327 --> 00:35:19,320
Even from his room at the far side
of the palace, I could hear him.

476
00:35:19,487 --> 00:35:23,116
No one else could. Not even Hera.

477
00:35:23,927 --> 00:35:25,326
Hera?

478
00:35:25,487 --> 00:35:27,398
Oh, yes, Hera.

479
00:35:29,167 --> 00:35:31,681
No, I don't think
she would have heard him.

480
00:35:37,167 --> 00:35:38,600
It's stopped.

481
00:35:38,767 --> 00:35:40,405
Oh, I'm glad.

482
00:35:40,567 --> 00:35:42,876
Yes. You wanted
to tell me something?

483
00:35:43,047 --> 00:35:46,517
Y-yes. It's about the s-statues.

484
00:35:46,687 --> 00:35:50,362
Yes, I wanted to talk to you
about that. You've noticed too?

485
00:35:50,527 --> 00:35:52,165
Noticed what?.

486
00:35:52,327 --> 00:35:56,161
Well. that none of the statues
of the gods in Rome look like me.

487
00:35:56,327 --> 00:35:58,124
I can't have that.

488
00:35:58,287 --> 00:36:01,359
I want you to collect
the statues of the gods in Rome

489
00:36:01,527 --> 00:36:04,166
and replace their heads
with one of my own.

490
00:36:04,327 --> 00:36:07,558
- Your own?
- Yes. And Hera's too.

491
00:36:08,167 --> 00:36:14,959
You can put her head
on the statue of Venus.

492
00:36:16,527 --> 00:36:18,518
Isn't she beautiful?.

493
00:36:18,687 --> 00:36:23,078
And she's pregnant.
She carries my child in her womb.

494
00:36:23,247 --> 00:36:26,159
The thought torments me.
What could it be like?

495
00:36:26,327 --> 00:36:30,878
Could it be greater than Zeus himself?.
Could it rule the universe?

496
00:36:32,007 --> 00:36:36,000
The statues of N-Nero and D-Drusus

497
00:36:36,167 --> 00:36:39,682
w=won't be ready for the ceremony.

498
00:36:40,567 --> 00:36:41,920
What?.

499
00:36:42,727 --> 00:36:48,643
The statues of your b-brothers
won't be ready in time.

500
00:36:49,367 --> 00:36:51,005
Won't be ready?. !

501
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:53,761
- It's not my fault...
- You've bungled it!

502
00:36:53,927 --> 00:36:57,397
You're an idiot! I was a fool
to have trusted you!

503
00:36:57,567 --> 00:37:01,355
I've a good mind to have your throat cut.
In fact I'll do it now!

504
00:37:01,527 --> 00:37:03,085
No! No! No!

505
00:37:03,247 --> 00:37:05,966
- What is it?. !
- Who is it?.

506
00:37:10,447 --> 00:37:12,005
Gemellus.

507
00:37:12,967 --> 00:37:16,164
- I've cured his cough.
- Oh, no.

508
00:37:16,327 --> 00:37:18,682
Oh, no!

509
00:37:20,887 --> 00:37:25,085
And you're not Consul any more!
You are dismissed!

510
00:37:25,727 --> 00:37:27,877
I'll find somebody else!

511
00:37:33,047 --> 00:37:36,198
- Take it away. It looks horrible.
- Yes, Caesar.

512
00:37:37,167 --> 00:37:40,159
Drusilla, wake up, please.

513
00:37:40,807 --> 00:37:44,561
Please, Drusilla, my head!

514
00:37:44,727 --> 00:37:46,046
Please.

515
00:37:55,047 --> 00:37:57,515
No one can be greater than Zeus.

516
00:37:59,807 --> 00:38:02,241
Not even the child of Zeus.

517
00:38:05,167 --> 00:38:08,125
There weren't many at the funeral.
were there?

518
00:38:08,287 --> 00:38:11,996
What did you expect?.
Caligula denounced him as a traitor.

519
00:38:12,167 --> 00:38:16,285
All the same, he was Tiberius'
grandson, and still only a boy.

520
00:38:16,447 --> 00:38:18,597
How can people believe
such nonsense?

521
00:38:18,767 --> 00:38:20,997
People will believe anything.

522
00:38:21,167 --> 00:38:25,285
We're fortunate he didn't celebrate
the funeral with games.

523
00:38:28,967 --> 00:38:31,162
I want to speak to Claudius alone.

524
00:38:31,327 --> 00:38:33,397
Of course. I'll go.

525
00:38:38,167 --> 00:38:42,240
Is there something wrong,
or has Gemellus' funeral upset you?

526
00:38:42,767 --> 00:38:44,439
It was the funeral

527
00:38:45,887 --> 00:38:48,685
- Goodbye, Herod.
- Goodbye.

528
00:38:52,407 --> 00:38:55,240
- Are you going away somewhere?
- Yes.

529
00:38:55,407 --> 00:38:58,717
At long last,
I'm going to join your father.

530
00:39:02,687 --> 00:39:06,441
- What do you mean?
- I'm going to kill myself.

531
00:39:07,767 --> 00:39:09,723
Don't start any nonsense.

532
00:39:10,967 --> 00:39:13,561
- But you can't.
- Oh, yes, I can.

533
00:39:13,727 --> 00:39:16,241
My life's my own.
It'll be a welcome release.

534
00:39:16,407 --> 00:39:18,967
I've no wish to go on living
in this place.

535
00:39:19,127 --> 00:39:21,402
You don't have to pretend
you'll miss me.

536
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:25,845
Of course I'll miss you.
You're my mother.

537
00:39:26,007 --> 00:39:29,886
That's very dutiful. considering
I've never been very loving to you.

538
00:39:30,047 --> 00:39:33,926
I'm sorry for that, but you've
always been a disappointment to me.

539
00:39:34,087 --> 00:39:38,080
- Oh, don't say that...
- You see? Crying at your age.

540
00:39:38,247 --> 00:39:41,683
- Well. why shouldn't I cry?.
- There's no need.

541
00:39:41,847 --> 00:39:45,123
Keep your tears for yourself,
you may need them. I shan't.

542
00:39:45,287 --> 00:39:48,438
- Don't do it, please.
- My mind is made up.

543
00:39:48,607 --> 00:39:50,643
I don't want to stay here any more.

544
00:39:50,807 --> 00:39:55,119
I was born into a world of people.
It's become a kennel of mad dogs.

545
00:39:55,287 --> 00:39:58,359
I've seen my splendid son,
Germanicus, murdered,

546
00:39:58,527 --> 00:40:01,200
and my grandsons,
Drusus, Nero, Gemellus.

547
00:40:01,367 --> 00:40:03,801
My grand-daughters are degenerate,

548
00:40:03,967 --> 00:40:06,879
and your sister, Livilla,
died by my own hand.

549
00:40:07,047 --> 00:40:11,199
That was the worst.
I should have died then myself.

550
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:16,805
W-wait a while. Caligula's sick
in his mind. Sooner or later...

551
00:40:16,967 --> 00:40:20,960
Rome is sick - sick to its heart.
He's just the rash she's come out in.

552
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:23,880
But he can't last f-forever.

553
00:40:24,047 --> 00:40:27,881
No. And I daresay
you'll survive him.

554
00:40:29,407 --> 00:40:32,444
You'd survive the Great Flood,
I know that now.

555
00:40:33,127 --> 00:40:34,719
But I've no wish to.

556
00:40:34,887 --> 00:40:39,005
I've stayed too long and it's good
manners to know when to leave.

557
00:40:42,287 --> 00:40:44,676
You'll find all my affairs in order.

558
00:40:44,847 --> 00:40:48,886
Pay my debts and be good to my slaves -
they’ve been very loyal

559
00:40:49,247 --> 00:40:51,283
I shall go down to Antium and do it.

560
00:40:51,447 --> 00:40:53,836
Come in five hours,
I shall be dead by then,

561
00:40:54,007 --> 00:40:58,159
but wait till Briseis confirms it
in case you catch my dying breath.

562
00:40:59,007 --> 00:41:01,999
I count on you
to pay me the last rites.

563
00:41:03,047 --> 00:41:06,676
Remember to cut off my hand
for separate burial

564
00:41:06,847 --> 00:41:10,476
for this will be suicide.
It'll be just like you to forget.

565
00:41:11,407 --> 00:41:15,036
And Claudius... Claudius.

566
00:41:17,407 --> 00:41:23,118
Please don't make a muddle
of the valedictory.

567
00:41:26,527 --> 00:41:28,324
You may kiss me.

568
00:41:29,967 --> 00:41:31,639
Oh, Mother.

569
00:41:38,807 --> 00:41:41,480
(HE SOBS)

570
00:42:13,327 --> 00:42:16,558
She's dead, Master. You can go in.

571
00:42:18,887 --> 00:42:20,320
How was it?.

572
00:42:20,487 --> 00:42:23,001
Oh, so easy, Master.

573
00:42:23,887 --> 00:42:25,798
When life so wants to escape,

574
00:42:25,967 --> 00:42:30,040
it takes but the touch of the knife
on the vein to let it flow away.

575
00:42:30,207 --> 00:42:32,357
She didn't cry out?.

576
00:42:33,247 --> 00:42:36,876
Only at the end.
I heard her call to your father.

577
00:42:37,687 --> 00:42:41,999
"Drusus, Drusus," she said.
"Forgive me, forgive me."

578
00:42:42,167 --> 00:42:43,759
Forgive me?

579
00:42:44,767 --> 00:42:47,600
Perhaps for keeping him waiting
for so long.

580
00:42:49,487 --> 00:42:52,957
I've taken her out of the bath.
She's covered with a sheet.

581
00:42:53,127 --> 00:42:55,163
You can go and see her now.

582
00:42:55,327 --> 00:42:58,842
Yes. Yes. I'll come in a m-minute.

583
00:43:01,087 --> 00:43:02,998
Don't be surd, Master.

584
00:43:03,167 --> 00:43:05,601
She wanted to go. It was no effort.

585
00:43:07,127 --> 00:43:09,687
Calm as you like, and brave.

586
00:43:10,887 --> 00:43:15,165
Well. she was Mark Antony's daughter
and Octavia's. You'd expect that.

587
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:21,806
I've cut off her hand
for separate burial

588
00:43:22,407 --> 00:43:24,363
Why did you do it?.

589
00:43:25,367 --> 00:43:27,358
She asked me to, Master.

590
00:43:29,207 --> 00:43:31,960
Perhaps she thought
it might slip your mind.

591
00:43:37,607 --> 00:43:39,279
Zeus!

592
00:43:41,647 --> 00:43:43,285
Zeus!

593
00:43:43,847 --> 00:43:47,203
My husband! Where are you?

594
00:43:48,527 --> 00:43:51,599
Oh, you're not Zeus.

595
00:43:52,327 --> 00:43:54,795
You're not my husband, Zeus.

596
00:43:54,967 --> 00:44:00,360
You're just my silly old
Uncle C-C-Claudius.

597
00:44:01,047 --> 00:44:06,075
It was your grandmother's funeral today.
Couldn't you have attended?

598
00:44:08,447 --> 00:44:11,325
Gods don't attend funerals.

599
00:44:11,487 --> 00:44:12,886
You're drunk.

600
00:44:13,047 --> 00:44:14,400
No.

601
00:44:15,367 --> 00:44:18,996
My husband found this wonderful
potion which we take.

602
00:44:19,927 --> 00:44:24,921
It makes you feel as if
you're riding through the air!

603
00:44:26,207 --> 00:44:30,564
Have you seen him - my husband?
He's hiding.

604
00:44:31,127 --> 00:44:33,322
Do you mean your b-brother?.

605
00:44:33,487 --> 00:44:35,876
Yes. My brother.

606
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:42,406
My divine potent brother.

607
00:44:43,727 --> 00:44:45,080
Potent.

608
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:51,201
Do you know he's to be a father?.

609
00:44:53,087 --> 00:44:56,159
Hera is with child by Zeus.

610
00:44:56,647 --> 00:44:59,207
Or Metis or Diana.

611
00:44:59,647 --> 00:45:03,925
Sometimes I'm one, sometimes I'm
the other. He gets a bit confused.

612
00:45:04,087 --> 00:45:06,681
Why do you play up to him like this?

613
00:45:07,527 --> 00:45:12,317
Why do you? You play the clown,
I play the goddess.

614
00:45:17,487 --> 00:45:19,318
You're disgusting!

615
00:45:20,247 --> 00:45:22,886
You wouldn't dare say that to him.

616
00:45:23,607 --> 00:45:29,079
You're afraid.
Well. we're all afraid - even he is.

617
00:45:34,087 --> 00:45:36,237
Do you know what he's afraid of?.

618
00:45:37,807 --> 00:45:39,320
This.

619
00:45:39,927 --> 00:45:44,603
He's afraid it will be more powerful
than he is and rule the heavens.

620
00:45:46,807 --> 00:45:49,446
Now I have something he's afraid of.

621
00:45:50,487 --> 00:45:52,239
Zeus!

622
00:45:53,247 --> 00:45:54,919
Zeus!

623
00:45:55,367 --> 00:45:58,598
Where are you? Zeus!

624
00:45:59,847 --> 00:46:03,726
Zeus, my treasure?
Are you in there?

625
00:46:08,487 --> 00:46:09,806
Zeus!

626
00:46:10,567 --> 00:46:11,886
Ah!

627
00:46:12,527 --> 00:46:16,281
Oh, you frightened me.

628
00:46:19,167 --> 00:46:21,965
Oh, it's magnificent.

629
00:46:23,567 --> 00:46:25,398
It'll tickle a bit.

630
00:46:27,447 --> 00:46:29,438
Why are you hiding in here?

631
00:46:29,607 --> 00:46:31,837
I wanted you to find me in here.

632
00:46:34,047 --> 00:46:38,245
You see, I've altered my whole room.

633
00:46:40,607 --> 00:46:42,199
Olympus.

634
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:45,920
We gods like to live
on mountain tops

635
00:46:46,087 --> 00:46:49,966
and while I live in this palace,
this reminds me of my real home.

636
00:46:52,047 --> 00:46:53,765
And what's this?

637
00:46:53,927 --> 00:46:57,078
A chariot to draw you
up to the clouds.

638
00:46:58,727 --> 00:47:00,160
Drink this.

639
00:47:00,327 --> 00:47:04,479
Oh, I think I've drunk enough.
Is it the same?

640
00:47:04,647 --> 00:47:08,720
It's the same. We gods drink it
before we perform a miracle.

641
00:47:08,887 --> 00:47:10,843
Drink it. Drink. Drink. Drink.

642
00:47:19,967 --> 00:47:22,003
You know I love you?

643
00:47:22,687 --> 00:47:25,042
More than anything
in the whole world?

644
00:47:25,767 --> 00:47:29,646
Let me show you how you'll
be drawn up into Olympus.

645
00:47:32,127 --> 00:47:33,526
You see...

646
00:47:35,047 --> 00:47:39,165
Golden bracelets to help you.

647
00:47:41,407 --> 00:47:43,557
To help you...

648
00:47:44,967 --> 00:47:46,320
ride.

649
00:47:46,487 --> 00:47:48,318
Shall we ride together?.

650
00:47:49,647 --> 00:47:51,285
Who am I?

651
00:47:51,447 --> 00:47:55,042
Zeus, Lord of Heaven, my husband.

652
00:47:55,207 --> 00:47:58,517
- Who are you?
- The Queen of Heaven, your wife.

653
00:47:58,687 --> 00:48:03,636
- Do you trust me?
- Oh, utterly, my lover, my lord.

654
00:48:04,367 --> 00:48:07,404
- There'll be no pain, I promise.
- Pain?

655
00:48:07,567 --> 00:48:10,639
Why, what do you want to do,
my angel?.

656
00:48:10,807 --> 00:48:13,082
You know I can resist you nothing.

657
00:48:17,807 --> 00:48:19,604
What are you doing?

658
00:48:20,367 --> 00:48:22,437
What do you want to do?

659
00:48:22,607 --> 00:48:27,761
Oh, tell the Queen of Heaven
what her lord and master wants.

660
00:48:29,487 --> 00:48:34,197
I must draw the child
from the Queen of Heaven's womb

661
00:48:34,367 --> 00:48:39,122
and swallow it whole, so a new child
may grow out of the head of Zeus.

662
00:48:39,287 --> 00:48:42,916
Oh, yes, darling. Draw it out.

663
00:48:43,087 --> 00:48:45,726
Let Zeus take the child and...

664
00:48:46,407 --> 00:48:49,843
Oh, let's go to bed.

665
00:48:50,607 --> 00:48:52,598
Your queen's very sleepy.

666
00:48:54,647 --> 00:48:58,003
What's that?.
What are you going to do?

667
00:48:58,887 --> 00:49:01,799
There'll be no pain, I know it.

668
00:49:01,967 --> 00:49:03,639
Pain? But why should...?

We are immortal gods!

Don't go in there.
