1
00:01:00,447 --> 00:01:05,760
I, Tiberius Claudius Drusus..

2
00:01:05,927 --> 00:01:08,999
Nero Germanicus..

3
00:01:10,607 --> 00:01:13,041
this-that-and-the-other...

4
00:01:13,327 --> 00:01:16,239
who was once, and not so long ago,

5
00:01:16,407 --> 00:01:20,798
better known to my friends
and relatives as Claudius the Idiot,

6
00:01:20,967 --> 00:01:23,527
or That Fool Claudius,

7
00:01:23,687 --> 00:01:26,201
or Claudius the Stammered...

8
00:01:27,367 --> 00:01:31,406
am now about to write
this strange history of my life.

9
00:01:35,687 --> 00:01:37,564
Are you there?

10
00:01:39,047 --> 00:01:41,925
Yes you're there. I can feel it

11
00:01:42,087 --> 00:01:44,760
I can feel your presence yes

12
00:01:44,927 --> 00:01:48,522
I knew you would come
the moment I began to write.

13
00:01:49,327 --> 00:01:52,125
Yes it was inevitable.

14
00:01:53,047 --> 00:01:55,880
it was prophesied by the Sibyl

15
00:02:10,607 --> 00:02:14,361
Spies. Spies everywhere
spying on me.

16
00:02:14,527 --> 00:02:18,315
In my bed at my prayers
on the street..

17
00:02:18,487 --> 00:02:21,206
Even in the lavatory. Spies!

18
00:02:21,367 --> 00:02:24,200
I'll cheat them every one.

19
00:02:27,487 --> 00:02:29,762
it was prophesied by the Sibyl

20
00:02:30,687 --> 00:02:34,236
I went to Cumae many years ago
to consult her.

21
00:02:35,647 --> 00:02:37,763
She was most famous

22
00:02:38,647 --> 00:02:41,480
Her prophecies had achieved
worldwide renown

23
00:02:41,647 --> 00:02:44,161
and she did not consent
to see everyone.

24
00:02:44,327 --> 00:02:47,763
Unexpectedly,
she consented to see me.

25
00:02:48,447 --> 00:02:50,517
I was terrified.

26
00:02:52,007 --> 00:02:54,475
"Oh Sibyl", I said

27
00:02:54,647 --> 00:03:00,165
"I've c-come to question you
about Rome's fate and mine."

28
00:03:00,927 --> 00:03:06,479
"Hear me Cl-Cl-Claudius, "
she answered mocking my stammer.

29
00:03:07,327 --> 00:03:10,125
"Apollo speaks to you through me.

30
00:03:10,287 --> 00:03:12,437
"Listen closely."

31
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:18,164
(WOMAN) What groans
beneath the Punic Curse

32
00:03:18,327 --> 00:03:21,399
And strangles
in the strings of purse

33
00:03:21,567 --> 00:03:25,446
Before she mends must sicken worse.

34
00:03:25,607 --> 00:03:30,806
Ten years, 50 days and three
Clau-Clau-Claudius shall given be

35
00:03:30,967 --> 00:03:35,518
A gift that all desire but he.

36
00:03:36,807 --> 00:03:41,244
But when he's dumb and no more here

37
00:03:42,127 --> 00:03:46,325
Nineteen hundred year or near,

38
00:03:46,487 --> 00:03:53,325
Clau-Clau-Claudius
shall speak clear.

39
00:03:55,967 --> 00:03:58,401
Yes That's what it means

40
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:03,486
In nineteen hundred years from now
they'll hear me.

41
00:04:03,647 --> 00:04:05,319
Not before.

42
00:04:06,207 --> 00:04:07,686
No.

43
00:04:08,967 --> 00:04:11,925
A box. I need a box.

44
00:04:14,807 --> 00:04:17,560
I'll put it all in here. My story.

45
00:04:17,727 --> 00:04:19,957
My history of the family. Yes

46
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:22,402
And the end of the Republic Yes

47
00:04:22,567 --> 00:04:26,640
When I've finished I'll seal it
and bury it where no one will find it

48
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:29,683
No. No one.

49
00:04:30,367 --> 00:04:33,165
Not for nineteen hundred years
or more.

50
00:04:33,327 --> 00:04:35,921
Then it will turn up suddenly.

51
00:04:36,087 --> 00:04:38,999
People will read it
They'll know the truth.

52
00:04:39,167 --> 00:04:43,001
My voice as the Sibyl said
as she prophesied

53
00:04:43,167 --> 00:04:46,443
for them -
not for these fools in Rome

54
00:04:46,607 --> 00:04:51,283
but for them out there
in remote posterity.

55
00:04:52,327 --> 00:04:53,885
For you.

56
00:04:54,767 --> 00:04:58,806
Yes. It will all be in here sealed.

57
00:04:59,567 --> 00:05:03,196
You will find it, I promise you.

58
00:05:13,047 --> 00:05:15,686
I, Claudius,

59
00:05:15,847 --> 00:05:20,159
am now about to begin
this strange history of my life...

60
00:05:20,927 --> 00:05:22,645
of my family.

61
00:05:22,807 --> 00:05:24,684
Of Livia my grandmother.

62
00:05:24,847 --> 00:05:28,760
Of Augustus Caesar.
Of Marcus Agrippa.

63
00:05:28,927 --> 00:05:30,997
Yes And his hatred for Marcellus

64
00:06:02,287 --> 00:06:04,562
Excellent! Excellent!

65
00:06:04,727 --> 00:06:06,160
Thallus!

66
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:10,918
See they’re well taken care of.
They were splendid.

67
00:06:11,087 --> 00:06:14,762
- Yes, Caesar.
- And see they’re properly fed.

68
00:06:14,927 --> 00:06:17,919
They’ll eat better
than the kitchen staff, Caesar.

69
00:06:18,087 --> 00:06:22,000
There's no need to go that far.
Better than us will be sufficient.

70
00:06:23,847 --> 00:06:27,635
You know, Marcus,
I like to eat sparingly.

71
00:06:27,807 --> 00:06:30,765
There's too much gluttony in Rome.

72
00:06:30,927 --> 00:06:35,398
But this one day is very special
I like to make an exception.

73
00:06:35,567 --> 00:06:40,721
And I've got a surprise for you.
Two, as a matter of fact.

74
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:42,846
Thallus!

75
00:06:44,327 --> 00:06:46,636
- Bring in the cake.

76
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:50,482
- But it's for the end of the meal
- I want the family to see it.

77
00:06:50,647 --> 00:06:54,686
Aristarchus of Athens is in Rome.

78
00:06:56,087 --> 00:07:00,797
Oh, Marcus. They say that he's
the greatest orator of our time,

79
00:07:00,967 --> 00:07:02,958
and he's going to prepare an oration

80
00:07:03,127 --> 00:07:05,436
for the anniversary
of the battle of Actium.

81
00:07:05,607 --> 00:07:09,122
- Oh, no!

82
00:07:09,287 --> 00:07:11,596
- We had one last year.
- That was last year.

83
00:07:11,767 --> 00:07:15,726
Anyway, the speaker was dull
This man, they say he's wonderful

84
00:07:15,887 --> 00:07:20,324
"Seven years today sank Antony
and his hopes in the harbour of Actium."

85
00:07:22,127 --> 00:07:25,358
How the young mock
the battle scars of their elders.

86
00:07:25,527 --> 00:07:28,200
- Battle scars!
- A lot of good men died there,

87
00:07:28,367 --> 00:07:32,155
and a lot of good men got scarred.
It's not right to make light of it.

88
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:34,283
- He's just being provocative.
- No.

89
00:07:34,447 --> 00:07:36,517
I think we exaggerate
its significance.

90
00:07:36,687 --> 00:07:39,645
Now, Marcellus, let's not argue.
Marcus...

91
00:07:39,807 --> 00:07:42,526
No. Let's hear
what the young genius has to say.

92
00:07:43,807 --> 00:07:47,277
- Well?.
- Look! Here is the cake.

93
00:07:47,447 --> 00:07:50,678
- Do we get one each?
- Julia, for heaven's sake!

94
00:07:52,247 --> 00:07:55,922
- Marcus, do you recognise it?.
- It's my ship.

95
00:07:56,087 --> 00:07:59,523
- You made it your headquarters.
- She was a fine ship.

96
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:03,475
That must be you, Marcus.
The candied cherry in the prow.

97
00:08:03,647 --> 00:08:05,638
(AUGUSTUS LAUGHS)

98
00:08:05,807 --> 00:08:09,243
Marcellus, please.
These things mean something to us.

99
00:08:09,407 --> 00:08:12,001
We're taking ourselves
a little seriously.

100
00:08:12,167 --> 00:08:13,885
(MARCUS) Not seriously enough.

101
00:08:14,047 --> 00:08:16,277
Livia, isn't that a wonderful cake?

102
00:08:16,447 --> 00:08:19,519
- Wonderful
- Don't you like it?.

103
00:08:20,607 --> 00:08:24,600
Bring in the Greek. If you keep him
waiting longer, he'll need a shave.

104
00:08:24,767 --> 00:08:26,837
As a matter of fact he's bearded.

105
00:08:27,927 --> 00:08:29,963
Thallus, bring in the Greek.

106
00:08:30,127 --> 00:08:32,118
- Leave the cake.
- Take the cake.

107
00:08:33,327 --> 00:08:37,240
Marcus, they say
that he writes a sort of prose hymn.

108
00:08:37,407 --> 00:08:40,558
What can that mean?
It's a form I've never heard of.

109
00:08:40,727 --> 00:08:43,036
One of these new Greek inventions.

110
00:08:43,207 --> 00:08:46,324
They’re always inventing.
Why are they so clever?.

111
00:08:46,487 --> 00:08:50,844
If they’re so clever, why are they
our province instead of vice versa?

112
00:08:52,567 --> 00:08:56,845
- Ah, Aristarchus, welcome.
- Hail. Caesar.

113
00:08:57,007 --> 00:08:59,077
I hope we haven't kept you waiting.

114
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:02,284
Come. We're ready now.

115
00:09:11,207 --> 00:09:13,084
Give us your piece.

116
00:09:13,247 --> 00:09:17,877
Give me your peace, Caesar,
and I shall gladly give you mine.

117
00:09:18,047 --> 00:09:20,117
Yes, of course. I'm sorry. Thallus.

118
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:29,081
Caesar calls for silence!

119
00:09:29,247 --> 00:09:32,796
What a voice.
Perhaps we should change places?

120
00:09:32,967 --> 00:09:36,516
Only the Romans can afford ushers
with a voice like that.

121
00:09:36,687 --> 00:09:39,440
- Did you have it trained?
- I was an actor, sir.

122
00:09:39,607 --> 00:09:42,519
That explains it. Resting, are you?

123
00:09:42,687 --> 00:09:44,678
No, sir. I've given it up.

124
00:09:44,847 --> 00:09:48,078
Everyone's an actor in Rome.
There isn't enough work.

125
00:09:48,247 --> 00:09:52,035
And what there is goes to friends.
It's the same everywhere.

126
00:09:52,207 --> 00:09:54,084
The theatre isn't what it was.

127
00:09:54,247 --> 00:09:56,681
No. And I'll tell you
something else.

128
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:59,486
It never was what it was.

129
00:09:59,647 --> 00:10:04,084
Thallus, please discuss your
personal problems in your own time.

130
00:10:11,087 --> 00:10:15,160
Today is a day to drink and dance!

131
00:10:16,047 --> 00:10:18,766
Let us rival the priests of Mars

132
00:10:18,927 --> 00:10:22,283
with feats to dock
the couches of the Gods.

133
00:10:25,527 --> 00:10:27,563
Seven summers past,

134
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:30,639
the wild queen, Cleopatra,

135
00:10:30,807 --> 00:10:35,119
dreaming her dreams of ruin
on your lovely Empire,

136
00:10:35,287 --> 00:10:38,757
sailed her hopes
into the harbour of Actium,

137
00:10:38,927 --> 00:10:44,081
and there, with noble Antony,
spa curses on the ships of Caesar

138
00:10:44,247 --> 00:10:48,365
and cried, "Sink Rome!
And all her minions.

139
00:10:48,527 --> 00:10:51,883
"Egypt's not for conquests!"

140
00:10:52,967 --> 00:10:57,245
But words do not kill
and curses sink no ships.

141
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:02,356
Before she could catch her
scented breath, mighty Agrippa...

142
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:05,280
(CLAUDIUS)
Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa.

143
00:11:05,447 --> 00:11:09,440
Old friend and commander
of the armies of Augustus -

144
00:11:09,607 --> 00:11:12,997
Emperor of Rome
and most remarkable man.

145
00:11:13,167 --> 00:11:17,001
But even more remarkable
was Livia his second wife.

146
00:11:17,167 --> 00:11:20,603
If Augustus ruled the world,
Livia ruled Augustus.

147
00:11:20,767 --> 00:11:24,601
Octavia - Augustus’ sister...

148
00:11:25,687 --> 00:11:27,678
mother of Marcellus

149
00:11:28,767 --> 00:11:33,477
And next to him, Julia
his wife - Augustus' only daughter.

150
00:11:34,607 --> 00:11:39,123
Augustus was now clearly
preferring Marcellus over Agrippa.

151
00:11:40,727 --> 00:11:42,718
And Agrippa knew it

152
00:11:43,807 --> 00:11:48,881
And Antony, once proud Antony,

153
00:11:49,047 --> 00:11:51,402
fearing to be last,

154
00:11:51,567 --> 00:11:55,958
chased her to the very gates
of heaven!

155
00:11:56,127 --> 00:11:59,597
Romans! Remember them!

156
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:07,079
Their fateful deaths grace
your lives today with living legend.

157
00:12:07,247 --> 00:12:10,045
Your names and theirs...

158
00:12:11,007 --> 00:12:17,162
in history,
will be forever intertwined.

159
00:12:23,207 --> 00:12:24,606
Wonderful

160
00:12:29,527 --> 00:12:31,040
Wonderful

161
00:12:33,287 --> 00:12:35,755
What a gift you Greeks have.

162
00:12:37,727 --> 00:12:40,719
Incidentally, the battle
wasn't like that.

163
00:12:40,887 --> 00:12:43,321
- No?
- No, not at all

164
00:12:44,327 --> 00:12:47,364
But you described it poetically.
I understand that.

165
00:12:47,527 --> 00:12:49,882
It was poetic licence.
I'm used to that.

166
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:54,802
I write a little poetry myself.
Could I show it to you sometime?

167
00:12:54,967 --> 00:12:58,004
- I'd be honoured, Caesar.
- It's nothing professional.

168
00:12:58,167 --> 00:13:01,045
but it's not bad,
though I say it myself.

169
00:13:01,207 --> 00:13:03,767
Ah, Thallus has found a place
for you.

170
00:13:03,927 --> 00:13:05,997
We'll talk some more later.

171
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:09,203
Wasn't that beautiful?.

172
00:13:09,367 --> 00:13:11,358
He doesn't know about naval battles.

173
00:13:11,527 --> 00:13:14,678
(MARCELLUS) Well. it wasn't
much of a battle, was it?.

174
00:13:14,847 --> 00:13:16,565
I beg your pardon?

175
00:13:16,727 --> 00:13:19,878
One wine-soaked lover
and his Egyptian whore?

176
00:13:20,047 --> 00:13:22,800
I could have put up
a better show myself.

177
00:13:22,967 --> 00:13:24,719
Now, now, Marcellus.

178
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:28,880
- Let's not fool ourselves.
- You know all about it, do you?

179
00:13:29,047 --> 00:13:32,039
Yes. I've studied that battle
and I'm not impressed.

180
00:13:32,207 --> 00:13:36,359
It wasn't a famous victory.
The result was a foregone conclusion.

181
00:13:36,527 --> 00:13:39,246
- Let's watch the acrobats...
- Just a minute!

182
00:13:39,407 --> 00:13:43,286
I won't be taught my kids who've
only just learned to piss in a pot.

183
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:48,521
When you've actually done something,
come back and talk to me again.

184
00:13:49,447 --> 00:13:51,961
- If you'll excuse me.
- Marcus, it's early.

185
00:13:52,127 --> 00:13:54,436
It seems late to me. Too late.

186
00:13:54,607 --> 00:13:57,326
Perhaps that's because
I'm such an old man!

187
00:14:05,487 --> 00:14:06,806
Thallus!

188
00:14:08,727 --> 00:14:10,558
Oh, get rid of them!

189
00:14:11,047 --> 00:14:12,844
Marcus!

190
00:14:14,127 --> 00:14:15,719
Marcus!

191
00:14:26,327 --> 00:14:29,399
My grandmother Livia.

192
00:14:29,567 --> 00:14:34,083
Her mind always turning.
Always scheming.

193
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:38,847
And I - Claudius?

194
00:14:39,007 --> 00:14:41,396
You ask, where am I?

195
00:14:42,167 --> 00:14:46,399
I am not yet born,
but will be soon.

196
00:14:47,767 --> 00:14:51,999
Now I must continue with the story
of the rivalry between Marcellus and Agrippa.

197
00:14:54,687 --> 00:14:56,279
(KNOCKING)

198
00:14:56,447 --> 00:14:58,085
(LIVIA) Yes?

199
00:15:04,527 --> 00:15:07,405
- Yes?
- Caesar is asking for you, Lady.

200
00:15:07,567 --> 00:15:10,684
- Yes. I'll come soon.
- He says at once.

201
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:13,236
Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa
is with him.

202
00:15:25,647 --> 00:15:27,638
You'd better come down.

203
00:15:28,567 --> 00:15:30,364
And wait outside.

204
00:15:31,207 --> 00:15:33,596
I don't understand you.

205
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:36,918
You want to leave Rome,
but you won't say why.

206
00:15:37,087 --> 00:15:41,160
- You don't need me here anymore.
- Let me be the judge of that.

207
00:15:41,327 --> 00:15:45,798
Appoint me Governor of Syria
and I'll deal with that Parthian king.

208
00:15:45,967 --> 00:15:49,084
- It's time someone did.
- He wants to leave Rome.

209
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:53,525
- Why, Marcus?
- He doesn't need me in Rome.

210
00:15:53,687 --> 00:15:56,759
That's not the reason.
You're not being straight with me.

211
00:15:56,927 --> 00:16:01,125
Not straight?.
Oh, no, don't say that to me.

212
00:16:01,367 --> 00:16:05,758
If one man has been straight with you,
it's Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa.

213
00:16:08,527 --> 00:16:11,041
- Is it Marcellus?
- Marcellus?

214
00:16:11,207 --> 00:16:13,960
- What's he got to do with it?.
- I don't know.

215
00:16:14,127 --> 00:16:17,085
Do you object to my
appointing him City Magistrate?

216
00:16:17,247 --> 00:16:19,556
It's got nothing to do
with Marcellus.

217
00:16:20,487 --> 00:16:24,116
He's a capable man - another
reason why you don't need me here.

218
00:16:24,287 --> 00:16:27,120
Look, Marcus, we're old friends.

219
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:30,916
We've shared a lot of campaigns.
If Marcellus has upset you...

220
00:16:31,087 --> 00:16:34,557
Lady, talk to him. It's not Marcellus.
I'm very fond of the boy.

221
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,046
We all are.

222
00:16:36,207 --> 00:16:40,166
His friends can be high-handed,
but I was young once and had friends.

223
00:16:40,327 --> 00:16:43,080
Yes. The greatest friend
a man ever had.

224
00:16:43,247 --> 00:16:47,001
- Marcus...
- I'm not a man to hide my feelings.

225
00:16:47,167 --> 00:16:49,362
- You know I feel the same.
- Of course.

226
00:16:49,527 --> 00:16:51,995
I'd have gone long ago
if I hadn't thought that.

227
00:16:52,167 --> 00:16:56,445
That's why I can say to you now
that I've got nothing against Marcellus.

228
00:16:57,207 --> 00:16:58,526
Nothing.

229
00:16:59,887 --> 00:17:02,242
He's a very gifted young man.

230
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:07,400
If you've advanced him ahead
of his years, that's only natural

231
00:17:07,567 --> 00:17:11,162
I'm very relieved to hear it.
I know there's been friction.

232
00:17:11,327 --> 00:17:15,605
Not between you and him,
but between his followers and yours.

233
00:17:15,767 --> 00:17:18,281
Followers? Who has followers?

234
00:17:18,447 --> 00:17:22,360
Oh, he may have followers.
Such things don't come within my notice.

235
00:17:22,527 --> 00:17:26,315
But me? I have followers? Show me.
Where are my followers?

236
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:29,043
Lady, do you see any?.

237
00:17:29,207 --> 00:17:32,040
Not followers,
but people like to make factions,

238
00:17:32,207 --> 00:17:35,244
and that makes bad feeling
faster than boiled asparagus.

239
00:17:35,407 --> 00:17:37,921
There's no bad feeling.

240
00:17:38,287 --> 00:17:42,075
You've put my mind at rest.
If you feel you have to leave Rome...

241
00:17:42,247 --> 00:17:44,283
I don't feel I have to leave.

242
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:46,802
I just think I could be more use
in the East.

243
00:17:52,407 --> 00:17:55,956
Of course, if you feel
you really need me in Rome...

244
00:17:56,127 --> 00:17:59,005
No, no, I'm sure you're right.
You usually are.

245
00:17:59,167 --> 00:18:01,442
Your instincts are always
very sound.

246
00:18:02,847 --> 00:18:04,758
When will you leave?

247
00:18:09,127 --> 00:18:10,958
In a few days.

248
00:18:11,127 --> 00:18:14,483
Then we'll have all Rome at Ostia
to see you off.

249
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:18,039
"For the Senate
and the People of Rome," eh?

250
00:18:18,207 --> 00:18:20,277
For the Senate
and the People of Rome!

251
00:18:23,487 --> 00:18:25,557
Goodbye, old friend.

252
00:18:26,927 --> 00:18:28,246
Goodbye.

253
00:18:40,687 --> 00:18:43,884
Damn him! What does he think he is?

254
00:18:44,047 --> 00:18:46,880
We know whom he thinks he is.
Your successor.

255
00:18:47,047 --> 00:18:50,278
He's too old!
I need to groom a younger man.

256
00:18:51,207 --> 00:18:54,005
We can't do without Marcus Agrippa.

257
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:56,886
Give him five months,
then call him back.

258
00:18:57,047 --> 00:18:58,958
- No.
- Do it, my dear.

259
00:18:59,127 --> 00:19:02,756
Better to call him back when you
don't need him than when you do.

260
00:19:02,927 --> 00:19:05,441
No! I know what I'm doing.

261
00:19:08,287 --> 00:19:12,565
My son is waiting outside to pay
his respects. Will you see him?

262
00:19:13,647 --> 00:19:15,080
Of course.

263
00:19:24,687 --> 00:19:28,362
Ah, Tiberius. You're off
to join our troops in Germany?.

264
00:19:28,527 --> 00:19:31,325
- Yes, Caesar.
- I'm sure you'll do well for us.

265
00:19:31,487 --> 00:19:33,637
Remember that we need good generals.

266
00:19:33,807 --> 00:19:36,241
The Empire won't hold together
without.

267
00:19:36,407 --> 00:19:40,241
Write to me. I like to have views
from all sides.

268
00:19:40,407 --> 00:19:43,205
It helps me to make up my mind
about things.

269
00:19:43,367 --> 00:19:44,766
Yes.

270
00:19:44,927 --> 00:19:47,043
And now I have things to do.

271
00:19:47,207 --> 00:19:48,959
Yes, yes, many things.

272
00:19:49,927 --> 00:19:53,920
Well. the best of luck go with you,
and all the Muses.

273
00:20:01,887 --> 00:20:04,037
I could have saved myself
the trouble.

274
00:20:04,207 --> 00:20:07,244
Oh, you're so keen
to save yourself trouble.

275
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:10,319
Did that cost you so much -
a hail and farewell?.

276
00:20:10,487 --> 00:20:14,241
- He doesn't like me.
- Well. we can't all be lovable,

277
00:20:14,407 --> 00:20:16,363
though we could try a bit harder.

278
00:20:16,527 --> 00:20:18,358
It's my nature. I can't change it.

279
00:20:18,527 --> 00:20:22,440
And wouldn't if you could.
You've a mighty high opinion of yourself.

280
00:20:22,607 --> 00:20:25,838
I wonder you didn't transfer
your hopes to my brother.

281
00:20:26,007 --> 00:20:28,475
I might have done that long ago

282
00:20:28,647 --> 00:20:32,765
if he didn't share the idiotic hopes
your father had of another Republic.

283
00:20:32,927 --> 00:20:36,078
Besides, I took the auspices
when you were born

284
00:20:36,247 --> 00:20:38,158
and they were very favourable.

285
00:20:38,327 --> 00:20:40,841
Not that old chicken story again.

286
00:20:41,007 --> 00:20:43,316
You may sneer all you like,

287
00:20:43,487 --> 00:20:46,797
but I marked a Zodiac
on the floor of the hen-house

288
00:20:46,967 --> 00:20:50,403
and a chicken came down
and rested on your birth sign.

289
00:20:50,567 --> 00:20:54,560
I took its egg and warmed it
in my hands and it hatched -

290
00:20:54,727 --> 00:20:59,676
a young cock chick, and it already
had a fine comb on its head.

291
00:21:01,487 --> 00:21:03,603
You haven't much patience, have you?

292
00:21:03,767 --> 00:21:05,997
You want everything at once.

293
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:11,476
Twenty years ago,
Augustus ruled with Mark Antony,

294
00:21:11,647 --> 00:21:17,085
but I could see that wouldn't last -
I could see one man would be king.

295
00:21:18,007 --> 00:21:22,285
So I divorced your father
and married Augustus and waited.

296
00:21:22,847 --> 00:21:26,999
Now where would I be now
if I'd wanted everything at once, eh?

297
00:21:27,167 --> 00:21:29,283
And where would you be?

298
00:21:29,447 --> 00:21:33,565
Where am I now for all your patience
and your prophetic chickens?

299
00:21:33,727 --> 00:21:37,481
You are my son and I am Augustus'
wife - that's where you are.

300
00:21:37,647 --> 00:21:41,322
And in the long run, that's better
than being anybody else,

301
00:21:41,487 --> 00:21:43,364
even Marcellus or Marcus Agrippa.

302
00:21:46,287 --> 00:21:48,721
Now you may kiss me
and take your leave.

303
00:21:54,487 --> 00:21:57,206
Remember my prophetic chickens
and have patience.

304
00:21:59,447 --> 00:22:03,520
Do well on the Rhine. Your brother
is covering himself with glory.

305
00:22:03,687 --> 00:22:06,724
- We mustn't fall behind.
- Have I ever?.

306
00:22:06,887 --> 00:22:08,320
No.

307
00:22:08,487 --> 00:22:12,765
In the less imaginative arts,
you are certainly to be relied upon.

308
00:22:15,407 --> 00:22:18,956
And now my grandmother's mind
turned more and more

309
00:22:19,127 --> 00:22:21,277
towards the removal of Marcellus

310
00:22:23,847 --> 00:22:27,522
Good day, Mother.
You look a little piqued. Are you feeling well?.

311
00:22:28,407 --> 00:22:31,205
- Lady.
- I slept badly last night.

312
00:22:31,367 --> 00:22:35,519
There's so much noise in the streets
at night. Can't we do something?

313
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:37,598
The traffic must move sometime.

314
00:22:37,767 --> 00:22:40,486
Would you have it move
during the day?.

315
00:22:40,647 --> 00:22:44,959
There's too many people in Rome.
They keep coming in from everywhere.

316
00:22:45,127 --> 00:22:47,322
Syria, Gaul. Germany.

317
00:22:47,487 --> 00:22:50,559
They’re the life blood.
They make Rome what it is.

318
00:22:50,727 --> 00:22:53,321
Noisy, garish and uninhabitable!

319
00:22:53,487 --> 00:22:56,797
It shall be even worse
when the Games begin.

320
00:22:56,967 --> 00:22:59,765
Look at that! Isn't it a beauty.

321
00:22:59,927 --> 00:23:01,838
- Off your tree?
- Of course.

322
00:23:02,007 --> 00:23:05,317
You know, you should eat more pears,
Livia.

323
00:23:05,487 --> 00:23:07,557
How can I? You pick them all

324
00:23:07,727 --> 00:23:10,400
I'll have some more sent
from the country.

325
00:23:10,567 --> 00:23:13,206
Marcellus, we must talk
about these games.

326
00:23:13,367 --> 00:23:17,121
- Yes. I want to do something new.
- That sounds familiar.

327
00:23:17,287 --> 00:23:21,644
I want to really celebrate
my appointment as City Magistrate.

328
00:23:21,807 --> 00:23:24,765
What earth quaking innovations
are we to see?

329
00:23:24,927 --> 00:23:27,202
Giraffes riding elephants?

330
00:23:27,367 --> 00:23:30,040
I want to tent in all the theatres.

331
00:23:30,207 --> 00:23:34,246
Turn the whole marketplace
into a gigantic multi-coloured marquee.

332
00:23:34,407 --> 00:23:36,204
- Cover it.
- That's all?.

333
00:23:36,367 --> 00:23:38,642
No. I have an idea for a battle

334
00:23:38,807 --> 00:23:42,163
between 50 Germans
and 50 blacks from Morocco.

335
00:23:42,327 --> 00:23:44,761
Yes. And who's going to pay
for all this?

336
00:23:44,927 --> 00:23:46,918
I am, for part.

337
00:23:47,327 --> 00:23:50,683
- And so are you.
- Yes, that's what I thought.

338
00:23:51,487 --> 00:23:56,083
Come on. Would you consider 20
Germans against 20 black Moroccans?

339
00:23:56,247 --> 00:23:58,317
He spoils him.

340
00:23:58,487 --> 00:24:02,366
It would be hard not to.
He has such winning ways.

341
00:24:02,527 --> 00:24:04,757
Oh, yes, he has winning ways
all right.

342
00:24:04,927 --> 00:24:07,919
People fall over themselves
to do things for him.

343
00:24:08,087 --> 00:24:10,840
I must go in. It's too hot.

344
00:24:11,527 --> 00:24:14,200
Come, Antonia, I think
you should lie down.

345
00:24:14,367 --> 00:24:15,880
Coming, Mother.

346
00:24:17,847 --> 00:24:21,965
I hear there was opposition in the Senate
to Marcellus' appointment.

347
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:25,358
Nothing to speak of.
Just some friends of Agrippa.

348
00:24:26,927 --> 00:24:31,000
They’re always ready to remind your father
there are no kings in Rome.

349
00:24:31,167 --> 00:24:34,239
I don't know why he puts up
with the Senate at all

350
00:24:34,407 --> 00:24:37,763
Your father observes the forms.
It's very important.

351
00:24:37,927 --> 00:24:40,760
Romans like to believe
they govern themselves.

352
00:24:40,927 --> 00:24:44,715
The older ones do perhaps,
but I don't think it matters to us.

353
00:24:44,887 --> 00:24:48,038
You should hear Marcellus' friends talk.

354
00:24:48,207 --> 00:24:50,163
He's very popular, isn't he?

355
00:24:50,327 --> 00:24:52,318
- Yes.
- With you too?

356
00:24:52,487 --> 00:24:56,275
- Why do you ask?
- Well. there are no children yet.

357
00:24:57,247 --> 00:24:59,761
There's no issue
between you and Father

358
00:24:59,927 --> 00:25:02,919
and you've been married
for 20 years.

359
00:25:03,807 --> 00:25:08,562
True. Still. I'm very happy
with your father.

360
00:25:08,727 --> 00:25:10,365
And I am with Marcellus.

361
00:25:10,527 --> 00:25:13,917
I'm pleased. There's no substitute
for a happy marriage.

362
00:25:14,087 --> 00:25:15,520
No.

363
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:20,641
Mind you, they seem to be few
and far between these days.

364
00:25:22,407 --> 00:25:25,763
I always thought Tiberius
was lucky with his Vipsania.

365
00:25:25,927 --> 00:25:29,522
Yes. Yes, they’re very much in love.

366
00:25:31,207 --> 00:25:34,916
You know, when I first married
your father,

367
00:25:35,087 --> 00:25:38,716
you and Tiberius were children
and you used to play together.

368
00:25:38,887 --> 00:25:41,162
- Do you remember?.
- Yes, I remember.

369
00:25:41,327 --> 00:25:45,843
And when you grew up, you seemed
so fond of one another.

370
00:25:46,487 --> 00:25:48,398
I once had hopes...

371
00:25:49,087 --> 00:25:51,123
Yes, I used to adore him.

372
00:25:53,047 --> 00:25:55,515

when one is young.

arranged. He's got a rhinoceros.

- An extraordinary beast.

It's got a horn on its nose.

So has Scipio's wife.
He could have used her.

He sent his deputy to govern Syria.

Well. I can manage without him now.

Only if the food
doesn't agree with him.

- Yes. Have you see it before?

464
00:33:20,167 --> 00:33:21,646
No.

465
00:33:21,807 --> 00:33:24,116
No, I've never see green before.

466
00:33:25,567 --> 00:33:27,683
Perhaps it's a good sign.

467
00:33:29,647 --> 00:33:31,319
Forgive me, Lady.

468
00:33:47,487 --> 00:33:49,125
You're thinner.

469
00:33:49,287 --> 00:33:52,597
You look better. The life
of the legions agrees with you.

470
00:33:52,767 --> 00:33:57,636
Have I ever complained? I'd as soon
be in camp on the Rhine as here.

471
00:34:00,847 --> 00:34:02,997
I had to call you back.

472
00:34:03,167 --> 00:34:07,240
Augustus is still in Greece touring
the provinces and Marcellus...

473
00:34:07,407 --> 00:34:11,525
- How is he?
- I think he may die.

474
00:34:11,687 --> 00:34:14,759
- Has Augustus been told?
- Yes, of course.

475
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:17,316
As soon as it began to look serious.

476
00:34:17,487 --> 00:34:20,763
- When did he fall ill?.
- About a month ago.

477
00:34:20,927 --> 00:34:25,079
Musar said it was just a chill.
but I could see it was more serious,

478
00:34:25,247 --> 00:34:27,397
so I decided I'd nurse him myself.

479
00:34:28,647 --> 00:34:31,161
Well. his wife and mother were away.

480
00:34:31,327 --> 00:34:34,125
I've been at his side day and night.

481
00:34:34,287 --> 00:34:37,643
I prepare all his food myself
and I see that he eats it.

482
00:34:38,567 --> 00:34:42,116
I wouldn't have thought you'd care
whether he lived or died.

483
00:34:42,287 --> 00:34:45,359
I care very much
whether he lives or dies.

484
00:34:46,647 --> 00:34:49,798
- Do Julia and his mother know?.
- Yes. They’re with him now.

485
00:34:49,967 --> 00:34:52,640
Julia is being hysterical.
of course,

486
00:34:52,807 --> 00:34:55,116
and his mother never stops praying.

487
00:34:55,487 --> 00:34:59,036
- Let's hope her prayers are heard.
- Yes, indeed.

488
00:34:59,207 --> 00:35:01,243
And mine too.

489
00:35:01,447 --> 00:35:02,880
Tell me...

490
00:35:04,807 --> 00:35:06,798
what do you think of Julia?

491
00:35:06,967 --> 00:35:09,037
Nothing. Why?.

492
00:35:09,207 --> 00:35:12,279
Nobody could accuse you
of being devious.

493
00:35:13,167 --> 00:35:16,204
- She thinks well of you.
- What's that supposed to mean?

494
00:35:16,367 --> 00:35:19,165
Nothing. She likes you, that's all
Always has.

495
00:35:19,327 --> 00:35:24,526
Mother, I'm a happily married man.
Julia doesn't interest me.

496
00:35:24,687 --> 00:35:28,043
Not even if you hung her naked
from the ceiling above my bed.

497
00:35:28,207 --> 00:35:30,596
She might even do that
if I asked her!

498
00:35:30,887 --> 00:35:33,117
Aren't you forgetting something?

499
00:35:33,287 --> 00:35:36,199
She's married to Marcellus
and he's not dead yet.

500
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:39,757
When I start to forget things,
you may light my funeral pyre

501
00:35:39,927 --> 00:35:42,361
and put me on it - dead or alive.

502
00:35:42,527 --> 00:35:45,803
Don't ask me to divorce Vipsania
because I won't do it.

503
00:35:45,967 --> 00:35:48,435
Oh, what a lover we have here!

504
00:35:48,607 --> 00:35:51,121
Did you bring back poems
from the Rhine?

505
00:35:51,287 --> 00:35:54,404
Vipsania's the only thing
that means anything to me.

506
00:35:54,567 --> 00:35:57,081
I thought a boy's mother
meant something.

507
00:35:57,247 --> 00:36:00,159
Well. you do mean something,
but so does she,

508
00:36:00,327 --> 00:36:02,716
so don't ask me to push her aside.

509
00:36:02,887 --> 00:36:05,640
I may ask more than that
before I finish.

510
00:36:07,487 --> 00:36:09,523
Where does all this get us?

511
00:36:09,687 --> 00:36:14,363
There's Marcellus and Agrippa,
and Augustus proffers them both to me.

512
00:36:14,527 --> 00:36:16,563
(WOMAN SCREAMS)

513
00:36:16,727 --> 00:36:18,240
Ye Gods!

514
00:36:19,007 --> 00:36:20,406
What's that?.

515
00:36:22,127 --> 00:36:25,164
It sounds as if there is now
only Agrippa.

516
00:36:25,367 --> 00:36:27,119
- He's dead!
- Julia!

517
00:36:27,287 --> 00:36:29,881
- He's dead!
- Julia!

518
00:36:31,167 --> 00:36:33,362
Julia! Julia.

519
00:36:36,967 --> 00:36:38,480
Control yourself!

520
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:45,881
That's no way for a Roman woman
to behave!

521
00:36:46,047 --> 00:36:47,924
But he's dead.

522
00:36:48,087 --> 00:36:51,875
He gave a great cry and then
he rolled over and fell on the bed.

523
00:36:52,047 --> 00:36:55,437
- He's dead! He's dead!
- Come along. Wait here.

524
00:36:55,607 --> 00:36:58,360
- He's dead.
- Tiberius, take care of Julia.

525
00:36:58,527 --> 00:37:01,325
This is very grave.
We must send to Augustus.

526
00:37:04,727 --> 00:37:06,080
Tiberius!

527
00:37:06,247 --> 00:37:08,556
I said take care of Julia!

528
00:37:17,247 --> 00:37:19,681
I did everything I could.

529
00:37:20,527 --> 00:37:22,006
Everything.

530
00:37:24,087 --> 00:37:26,043
I did everything I could.

531
00:37:26,207 --> 00:37:30,200
Everything I did for Augustus I did
for him, but it made no difference.

532
00:37:30,367 --> 00:37:32,483
He's dead? You're sure he's dead?

533
00:37:34,687 --> 00:37:38,566
My son is dead. You can be sure.

534
00:37:40,287 --> 00:37:43,916
Poor Augustus. His heart will break.

535
00:37:44,087 --> 00:37:46,396
It must have been food poisoning.

536
00:37:46,567 --> 00:37:48,683
What do you mean, food poisoning?

537
00:37:49,407 --> 00:37:53,639
Well. the summer's been so hot.
These things happen.

538
00:37:56,887 --> 00:38:01,403
Yes. Yes, of course.
Well. there has been a lot of it about.

539
00:38:02,127 --> 00:38:06,678
I thought it was a chill.
but I was wrong. Wrong!

540
00:38:08,447 --> 00:38:11,007
It must have been something he ate.

541
00:38:26,567 --> 00:38:29,161
There ought to be an inquest,
I suppose.

542
00:38:29,327 --> 00:38:32,399
No. There's no need of that.
We know what he died of.

543
00:38:33,287 --> 00:38:35,755
- Do we?
- Food poisoning!

544
00:38:36,287 --> 00:38:38,357
You said so yourself!

545
00:38:39,407 --> 00:38:40,726
Yes.

546
00:38:45,207 --> 00:38:47,801
I couldn't swear to it.

547
00:38:47,967 --> 00:38:49,286
No...

548
00:38:50,407 --> 00:38:51,999
but I could.

549
00:38:56,487 --> 00:38:59,638
Tiberius, take Julia to her room
and comfort her.

550
00:39:05,407 --> 00:39:07,477
Stay with her a while.

551
00:39:13,487 --> 00:39:16,365
I'll send word to your wife
what keeps you.

the most likely explanation."

(CLAUDIUS) Rome erupted into fury.

560
00:39:53,167 --> 00:39:57,285
Marcellus' death led to demands
for a return of the Republic -

561
00:39:57,447 --> 00:39:59,563
the last thing my grandmother wanted.

They’re rampaging through
the streets, looting the shops.

All the City Watchmen are out.

Oh, you drooping lily! Do you want
us all to be murdered in our beds?

- Go and talk to them, then.
- Are you mad?

No. And I'm not frightened
of that rabble either.

all over again?

behave like a normal woman!

you need normal men around you.

We must get Agrippa back. He's the only one
who speaks their language.

he must patch up this quarrel

get in the way of friendship.

- You could have come sooner.
- How could I have come?

I'd have come to you.
Just one word - a hint, that's all

Would I have stayed away
if I'd been sure of my welcome?

Did you have a good journey?.

The see was rough,
but I didn't really notice it.

I was thinking of when
we were young together.

600
00:42:31,767 --> 00:42:34,201
It's too painful
to think of one's youth.

601
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:37,518
- We've come a long way together.
- Not always together.

602
00:42:37,687 --> 00:42:40,520
Marcus, you were always
in my thoughts.

603
00:42:40,687 --> 00:42:43,759
It wasn't always obvious.
No, be just with me.

604
00:42:43,927 --> 00:42:46,805
There were times -
oh, I can remember them -

605
00:42:46,967 --> 00:42:49,686
when that young man -
and I'm sorry he's dead...

606
00:42:50,607 --> 00:42:53,804
When that young man
went out of his way to insult me

607
00:42:53,967 --> 00:42:57,801
with never a word of reproof from you.
From my old friend, not a word.

608
00:42:57,967 --> 00:43:01,118
Marcus, he was like a son to me.

609
00:43:02,047 --> 00:43:04,800
You have children.
You know what it's like.

610
00:43:04,967 --> 00:43:07,925
Perhaps I was foolish.
Perhaps I did indulge him.

611
00:43:08,847 --> 00:43:12,840
But it seemed like high spirits,
that's all - a little horseplay.

612
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:15,919
- Haven't we all been guilty of it?.
- Maybe.

613
00:43:17,127 --> 00:43:19,004
I'm sorry he's dead.

614
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:22,000
I wouldn't have wished it,
though he was no friend.

615
00:43:22,167 --> 00:43:23,520
Yes.

616
00:43:27,247 --> 00:43:29,681
I need my old friend again.

617
00:43:30,647 --> 00:43:33,923
Now Marcellus is gone,
you need Agrippa.

618
00:43:34,087 --> 00:43:36,078
No, no, no, you must believe me.

619
00:43:36,247 --> 00:43:38,522
I'd already made up my mind
to see you.

620
00:43:38,687 --> 00:43:42,680
Would I pass Lesbos without calling in?
It's unthinkable.

621
00:43:45,127 --> 00:43:48,756
No, Marcus, I need you back in Rome.

622
00:43:50,727 --> 00:43:54,845
I don't know. I don't know
if I'm up to it anymore.

623
00:43:59,127 --> 00:44:01,004
Things are bad there, I hear.

624
00:44:01,167 --> 00:44:05,365
Oh, there's been a little trouble.
That's not why I want you back.

625
00:44:05,527 --> 00:44:08,485
I want you back
because that's where you belong.

626
00:44:08,647 --> 00:44:11,400
My old friend should be in Rome
with me.

627
00:44:11,567 --> 00:44:13,876
I need that strong right arm again.

628
00:44:15,607 --> 00:44:17,563
What do you say?.

629
00:44:24,047 --> 00:44:25,560
It's yours!

630
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:27,365
Marcus!

631
00:44:29,207 --> 00:44:30,606
But err...

632
00:44:32,367 --> 00:44:33,766
But?.

633
00:44:33,927 --> 00:44:37,806
Let's seal this bond tighter
than it's ever been before.

634
00:44:37,967 --> 00:44:39,286
How?.

635
00:44:39,447 --> 00:44:41,563
What's closer than a family tie?

636
00:44:41,727 --> 00:44:45,845
To be related is a declaration
of what we mean to each other.

637
00:44:46,567 --> 00:44:50,560
- You're thinking of your children?
- No. I'm thinking of myself.

638
00:44:51,247 --> 00:44:54,796
- I don't get on with my wife.
- I didn't know that.

639
00:44:54,967 --> 00:44:57,083
We haven't slept together for years.

640
00:44:57,247 --> 00:45:01,399
I'm speaking a little soon, I know,
and one must observe the decencies,

641
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:03,762
but Julia's a young woman.

642
00:45:03,927 --> 00:45:07,317
She'll get married again soon.
Well. why not to me?

643
00:45:09,127 --> 00:45:11,641
- To you?
- Well. why not?.

644
00:45:13,687 --> 00:45:16,724
Don't tell me I'm not good enough
for your family.

645
00:45:24,367 --> 00:45:26,119
Why not?.

646
00:45:26,287 --> 00:45:30,644
It's a deal You'll be my son-in-law,
have you thought of that?.

647
00:45:30,807 --> 00:45:33,002
I've thought of nothing else!

648
00:45:33,167 --> 00:45:34,839
(LIVIA) Why?

649
00:45:35,007 --> 00:45:37,362
Why did you agree to it?.

650
00:45:37,527 --> 00:45:39,757
Because he wanted it.
It was his price.

651
00:45:39,927 --> 00:45:42,122
- His price!
- What could I say?.

652
00:45:42,287 --> 00:45:44,164
You could have said no!

653
00:45:44,327 --> 00:45:47,125
No, I could not!
I saw no reason to say no.

654
00:45:47,287 --> 00:45:50,962
- I understood why he wanted it.
- So could anyone!

655
00:45:51,127 --> 00:45:54,164
- What would you have done?
- I could have handled him.

656
00:45:54,327 --> 00:45:55,680
How?.

657
00:45:55,847 --> 00:45:59,362
I would have reminded him
that he's a man of no background

658
00:45:59,527 --> 00:46:02,599
and that he cannot assume
to enter the Julian family.

659
00:46:02,767 --> 00:46:05,076
- And you would have lost him!
- I would not!

660
00:46:05,247 --> 00:46:07,715
Lost him as quick
as boiled asparagus.

661
00:46:07,887 --> 00:46:10,242
That is the most foolish expression.

662
00:46:10,407 --> 00:46:12,921
It's my expression!
I'll use it when I like!

663
00:46:16,207 --> 00:46:19,961
Why are you so opposed to this
marriage? I see no reason for it.

664
00:46:20,127 --> 00:46:23,403
It gives him more than he deserves.

665
00:46:23,567 --> 00:46:25,558
There's another reason. What is it?.

666
00:46:25,727 --> 00:46:27,957
There is no other reason!

667
00:46:29,327 --> 00:46:32,319
Except... Except...

668
00:46:32,487 --> 00:46:34,842
You might have consulted Julia first.

669
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:37,840
Are we now to ignore the wishes
of our children

670
00:46:38,007 --> 00:46:40,919
and sell them
as if they were solves?

671
00:46:42,087 --> 00:46:44,078
Have you no feelings?

672
00:46:53,207 --> 00:46:55,198
But she got her way in the end.

673
00:46:57,727 --> 00:47:01,879
Nine years passed before Agrippa's
services could be spared.

674
00:47:02,647 --> 00:47:06,959
Then he died - poisoned by Livia.

675
00:47:08,007 --> 00:47:11,682
Tiberius divorced his wife
and married Julia.

676
00:47:11,847 --> 00:47:13,838
(BALL BOUNCES)

677
00:47:15,607 --> 00:47:17,882
Drusus, my father -

678
00:47:18,047 --> 00:47:20,277
Tiberius’ beloved brother..

679
00:47:20,847 --> 00:47:25,637
But then everybody loved my father,
except Livia...his mother.

680
00:47:26,887 --> 00:47:28,559
Wicked woman.

681
00:47:29,767 --> 00:47:31,644
You're getting soft.

682
00:47:32,687 --> 00:47:36,726
You wouldn't last a five-hour march
in the army. Throw it!

683
00:47:37,087 --> 00:47:39,282
Oh, come on! Throw it!

684
00:47:41,047 --> 00:47:43,117
Antonia throws harder than that.

685
00:47:43,727 --> 00:47:45,638
Shut up! Throw the ball

686
00:47:48,687 --> 00:47:51,247
If you lost some of that stomach
of yours...

687
00:47:53,527 --> 00:47:55,757
Now we'll see who's hard.

688
00:48:39,087 --> 00:48:41,806
- Death or surrender?.
- Oh, get off.

689
00:48:42,287 --> 00:48:43,606
Ha!

690
00:48:45,087 --> 00:48:47,920
I never thought I'd see you
in such a condition.

691
00:48:48,087 --> 00:48:50,681
Spend ten years in Rome
and see how you feel

692
00:48:57,047 --> 00:48:58,400
Hay...

693
00:48:59,007 --> 00:49:01,123
What's this, eh? Sulks?

694
00:49:01,967 --> 00:49:05,846
You're lucky. You go back
to the army tomorrow.

695
00:49:07,047 --> 00:49:09,641
That's the only decent life
for a Roman.

696
00:49:11,007 --> 00:49:14,124
Marching, fighting, building forts.

697
00:49:15,887 --> 00:49:18,082
Those were the best years
of my life.

698
00:49:18,247 --> 00:49:20,477
You made the army's life
bloody hell

699
00:49:20,647 --> 00:49:24,925
I drilled them hard, but I was fair.
I'll boot they say I was fair.

700
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:28,523
- Do you know what they really say?.
- What?.

701
00:49:30,287 --> 00:49:34,041
They say that your drills
were bloodless battles...

702
00:49:35,167 --> 00:49:37,635
and your battles were bloody drills.

703
00:49:40,647 --> 00:49:44,242
- Is that what they say?. Really?.
- Yes.

704
00:49:46,487 --> 00:49:50,321
You know, that army I took
across the Alps, they were men.

705
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:54,719
- You've never had men like that.
- We've won some victories too.

706
00:49:54,887 --> 00:49:58,357
I know, I know.
But those two legions...

707
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:00,518
The twelfth and the sixteenth?

708
00:50:00,687 --> 00:50:02,598
You'll never see their like again.

709
00:50:02,767 --> 00:50:05,964
Nothing bothered them -
the heat, the cold...

710
00:50:07,127 --> 00:50:08,799
the marching.

711
00:50:08,967 --> 00:50:11,561
Oh, I cursed them
and I flogged them,

712
00:50:11,727 --> 00:50:14,321
but I cursed and flogged
their officers too.

713
00:50:14,487 --> 00:50:16,762
If there weren't any tents
for the men,

714
00:50:16,927 --> 00:50:19,157
I slept out in the open with them.

715
00:50:20,327 --> 00:50:22,887
You'll have to take the field again.

716
00:50:24,167 --> 00:50:27,239
- He won't let me.
- Who, Augustus?

717
00:50:28,927 --> 00:50:31,395
He keeps me here as his work donkey.

718
00:50:32,447 --> 00:50:36,201
Says he can't spare me.
I'm his chief errand boy.

719
00:50:37,767 --> 00:50:42,363
I spend my time investigating
the level of unemployment.

720
00:50:47,087 --> 00:50:49,920
Or reorganising
the city fire brigade.

721
00:50:51,207 --> 00:50:56,327
Added to that, there's that bitch
Julia they made me marry.

722
00:50:59,327 --> 00:51:04,162
Oh, he's just impossible.
Sometimes he doesn't speak to me for days.

723
00:51:04,327 --> 00:51:08,400
He was always very broody,
according to Drusus, even as a child.

724
00:51:08,567 --> 00:51:10,558
Drusus can always make him laugh.

725
00:51:10,727 --> 00:51:14,720
Drusus only knows him as a brother.
He ought to be married to him.

726
00:51:15,687 --> 00:51:17,962
You know, Antonia,
I'm very easygoing.

727
00:51:18,127 --> 00:51:20,322
Do you want that toe to drop off?. !

728
00:51:20,487 --> 00:51:22,603
There's a stiffness in the joint.

729
00:51:22,767 --> 00:51:25,679
There wasn't before you
started to work on it.

730
00:51:25,847 --> 00:51:29,681
They daydream. They’ll spend all day
massaging a toe if you let them.

731
00:51:29,847 --> 00:51:33,442
- She's probably in love.
- I hope she has better luck than me.

732
00:51:33,607 --> 00:51:36,485
- What was I talking about?.
- About Tiberius.

733
00:51:36,647 --> 00:51:39,115
He never wanted to divorce Vipsania.

734
00:51:39,287 --> 00:51:42,245
That stalk of a thing?
I don't know what he saw in her.

735
00:51:42,407 --> 00:51:44,557
She's as thin as a stick.

736
00:51:44,727 --> 00:51:48,083
He used to spend half of every night
in bed looking for her!

737
00:51:48,247 --> 00:51:50,124
- Julia!
- It's true.

738
00:51:50,287 --> 00:51:54,166
If the sheets got a bit crumpled,
she disappeared until morning.

739
00:51:54,327 --> 00:51:57,160
He was lucky if they found her
when they made the bed.

740
00:51:57,327 --> 00:52:00,603
- She's not that thin!
- I don't know what you call thin,

741
00:52:00,767 --> 00:52:04,237
but I saw old Valerius
after he starved himself to death

742
00:52:04,407 --> 00:52:06,443
and he looks better than she looks!

743
00:52:07,687 --> 00:52:09,643
I could never see the attraction.

744
00:52:09,807 --> 00:52:13,846
After ten years, I'd have thought
he'd be glad to see the back of her.

745
00:52:14,007 --> 00:52:17,841
That's the trouble. He was
always glad to see the back of her.

746
00:52:20,167 --> 00:52:24,160
- Julia, what on earth do you mean?
- Well. he's very strange.

747
00:52:25,527 --> 00:52:28,837
You're too sensitive a person
for me to go into details.

748
00:52:29,007 --> 00:52:30,645
Julia, he doesn't...?

749
00:52:30,807 --> 00:52:33,924
Oh, I could put up with that.

750
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:38,646
I'm not like you. I could probably
teach him a thing or two.

751
00:52:38,807 --> 00:52:40,843
But it's the coldness.

752
00:52:41,007 --> 00:52:46,240
I can't get near him. Even snow will
melt on a warm day, but not him.

753
00:52:46,407 --> 00:52:49,922
- I had no idea.
- And he hates Gaius and Lucius.

754
00:52:50,087 --> 00:52:54,046
- He hates my boys. They’re sweet.
- Very sweet.

755
00:52:55,727 --> 00:53:00,118
And to think I was once mad about him.
What fools we women are.

756
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:03,643
Augustus should never
have insisted on the marriage.

757
00:53:03,807 --> 00:53:07,766
Don't blame my father. Blame Livia.
If anyone insisted, she did.

758
00:53:07,927 --> 00:53:12,159
She tried the same thing ten years ago,
but Agrippa got in first.

759
00:53:12,327 --> 00:53:15,319
- I didn't know that.
- No. You were too young.

760
00:53:16,287 --> 00:53:18,357
That's all right. I've had enough.

761
00:53:19,287 --> 00:53:22,757
When Marcellus died,
she had everything planned.

762
00:53:22,927 --> 00:53:26,886
She knew how I felt about Tiberius
and she wanted us to marry,

763
00:53:27,047 --> 00:53:29,242
but Agrippa had the same idea,

764
00:53:29,407 --> 00:53:34,003
and Augustus needed him more than he
needed her son, so she had to wait.

765
00:53:34,167 --> 00:53:37,921
And can she wait! Ye Gods,
time means nothing to her!

766
00:53:38,487 --> 00:53:41,684
- Poor Marcellus.
- That must have been terrible.

767
00:53:41,847 --> 00:53:43,599
To tell you the truth...

768
00:53:44,767 --> 00:53:46,564
Leave us. I'll call you.

769
00:53:48,687 --> 00:53:51,201
Off you go. Go.

770
00:53:56,127 --> 00:53:57,845
To tell you the truth,

771
00:53:58,007 --> 00:54:01,682
it's crossed my mind that Livia
might have had a hand in that.

772
00:54:01,847 --> 00:54:03,485
Julia!

773
00:54:03,647 --> 00:54:06,957
I might be wrong, but he was
a strong, healthy man,

774
00:54:07,127 --> 00:54:11,120
and he never had a serious illness
until she got her hands on him.

775
00:54:11,287 --> 00:54:13,198
I often wonder about that woman.

776
00:54:16,127 --> 00:54:20,245
Antonia, you're so innocent!

777
00:54:20,407 --> 00:54:24,639
Hah! Not so innocent. Ask Drusus.

778
00:54:26,647 --> 00:54:30,959
I might just do that one of these
days if I get him in the mood!

779
00:54:31,127 --> 00:54:32,719
He's very attractive.

780
00:54:34,727 --> 00:54:38,800
Why is it that when I come in here
with you, I cover myself up,

781
00:54:38,967 --> 00:54:40,685
but normally I don't bother?.

782
00:54:40,847 --> 00:54:44,601
Well. you should. I don't approve
of all this nakedness.

783
00:54:46,767 --> 00:54:49,327
Oh, Antonia!

784
00:54:49,487 --> 00:54:52,240
I shall miss you
when you leave tomorrow.

785
00:54:52,407 --> 00:54:53,965
Not so hard.

786
00:54:54,127 --> 00:54:56,118
The dirt's ingrained in the skin.

787
00:54:56,287 --> 00:54:59,962
- It goes deeper than that.
- Your gloom is magnificent.

788
00:55:00,527 --> 00:55:03,041
Not so hard
or I'll get my men to do it.

789
00:55:03,207 --> 00:55:05,721
I can't think why
you won't let them anyway.

790
00:55:05,887 --> 00:55:09,118
A man should keep himself clean,
not have slaves do it.

791
00:55:09,287 --> 00:55:11,960
How's he supposed to scrape
his own back?

792
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:15,324
- He gets his brother to do it.
- If he hasn't a brother?.

793
00:55:15,487 --> 00:55:17,239
- Gets his son.
- If he hasn't a son?

794
00:55:17,407 --> 00:55:19,762
- Gets his friend.
- If he hasn't a friend?

795
00:55:19,927 --> 00:55:21,963
Then he should go and hang himself.

796
00:55:22,127 --> 00:55:25,881
I've tried it. It's better
to have a slave scrape your back.

797
00:55:27,927 --> 00:55:30,236
You know, I shall miss you.

798
00:55:31,567 --> 00:55:35,560
- You don't have any dark thoughts.
- Nonsense. We all have them.

799
00:55:35,727 --> 00:55:38,366
Not like me. Not like me.

800
00:55:38,527 --> 00:55:40,518
You're no worse than the rest of us.

801
00:55:40,687 --> 00:55:42,678
I'll tell you something, Drusus.

802
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:48,843
Sometimes I so hate myself, I can't
bear the thought of me anymore.

803
00:55:51,727 --> 00:55:54,685
You don't know anything
about darkness, do you?

804
00:55:55,327 --> 00:55:59,002
Inside darkness. Blackness.

805
00:55:59,167 --> 00:56:02,284
Stop bragging! I could match you
black for black.

806
00:56:02,447 --> 00:56:05,405
Not you. Not you.

807
00:56:05,567 --> 00:56:09,879
The Claudian tree produces two kinds
of apples - the sweet and the sour.

808
00:56:10,047 --> 00:56:12,515
That was never more true
than you and me.

809
00:56:12,687 --> 00:56:14,803
And what of our mother,
which is she?

810
00:56:14,967 --> 00:56:16,480
- Livia?
- Mmm.

811
00:56:16,647 --> 00:56:19,957
They say a snake bit her once
and died.

812
00:56:20,367 --> 00:56:23,165
Hay, that's no longer funny.

813
00:56:26,647 --> 00:56:29,445
I've only cared for three people
in my life.

814
00:56:29,607 --> 00:56:32,075
- One was our father.
- The noblest of us all

815
00:56:32,247 --> 00:56:33,999
Yes. The other was Vipsania.

816
00:56:34,167 --> 00:56:37,443
Yes. I was sorry about that.
Why did you divorce her?.

817
00:56:37,607 --> 00:56:41,361
Livia insisted on it. Julia wanted it.
Augustus insisted on it.

818
00:56:41,527 --> 00:56:45,156
All the same, you were so happy,
you might have refused.

819
00:56:47,047 --> 00:56:50,164
Do you think the monarchy
will survive Augustus?

820
00:56:53,607 --> 00:56:59,398
No, I don't. Rome will be
a republic again, I promise you that.

821
00:57:01,207 --> 00:57:03,721
Then perhaps I did it all for nothing.

822
00:57:10,887 --> 00:57:12,878
Is that why you did it?.

823
00:57:13,927 --> 00:57:15,883
Is that really?.

824
00:57:17,327 --> 00:57:20,956
But there are Julia's sons.
They’ll come before you anyway.

825
00:57:25,687 --> 00:57:27,484
My poor brother.

826
00:57:28,687 --> 00:57:32,396
- So ambitious.
- Our mother makes me so.

827
00:57:37,087 --> 00:57:39,760
Oh, God, I miss her so!

828
00:57:39,927 --> 00:57:41,406
Vipsania.

829
00:57:47,167 --> 00:57:49,362
What did they make me do?

830
00:57:49,927 --> 00:57:51,440
Tiberius.

831
00:57:54,767 --> 00:57:56,917
What's done is done.

832
00:58:00,247 --> 00:58:01,919
Yes.

833
00:58:02,967 --> 00:58:04,844
Yes, it's done.

834
00:58:06,727 --> 00:58:08,558
I must forget her.

835
00:58:10,927 --> 00:58:14,886
Vipsania was the second
and she's gone.

836
00:58:17,887 --> 00:58:19,718
You're the third.

837
00:58:19,887 --> 00:58:22,242
Well. you know I feel the same way.

838
00:58:23,607 --> 00:58:26,883
You should have my nature
and I yours.

839
00:58:27,047 --> 00:58:30,642
- Why?.
- I'm older. I should protect you.

840
00:58:30,807 --> 00:58:32,798
Well. we'll protect each other.

841
00:58:33,727 --> 00:58:35,524
I don't know what from.

842
00:58:37,087 --> 00:58:39,521
There are many things
you don't know.

843
00:58:41,487 --> 00:58:44,797
- If anything happens to you...
- What could happen?

844
00:58:46,567 --> 00:58:48,558
You could be killed in battle.

845
00:58:49,407 --> 00:58:51,796
- Or you could fall sick and die.
- Yes.

846
00:58:51,967 --> 00:58:56,757
And you could cut your throat shaving
or choke on a plum stone.

847
00:58:57,767 --> 00:59:00,839
Tiberius, none of us
is guaranteed a time.

848
00:59:04,167 --> 00:59:05,486
No.

849
00:59:09,607 --> 00:59:12,041
You're my lifeline into the light.

850
00:59:16,767 --> 00:59:18,359
Six again!

851
00:59:19,287 --> 00:59:22,836
One, two, three, four, five, six

852
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:24,804
Now what will you do?

853
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:29,123
I'll put two legions in the port
and stop the corn supply.

854
00:59:29,287 --> 00:59:32,484
Not bad.
Rome can't live without corn.

855
00:59:32,647 --> 00:59:37,038
You've got your back to the sea
and that's not good. It's your decision.

856
00:59:37,207 --> 00:59:39,004
Lucius, your turn.

857
00:59:41,367 --> 00:59:45,201
- Six!
- These dice have nothing but sixes.

858
00:59:45,367 --> 00:59:49,724
One, two, three, four, five, six
Belgica, Belgic's mine.

859
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:51,718
Go on, throw again.

860
00:59:53,847 --> 00:59:55,166
Two.

861
00:59:57,007 --> 01:00:01,876
- One, two. I'll take Britain.
- You've only got three legions.

862
01:00:04,207 --> 01:00:07,040
- Julius did it.
- He didn't stay long though.

863
01:00:07,727 --> 01:00:09,718
Yes, what is it?.

864
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:14,122
Caesar, your stepson Drusus Nero
begs to take his leave.

865
01:00:14,287 --> 01:00:17,962
- Yes, you can come with me.
- Can't we finish the game?

866
01:00:18,127 --> 01:00:21,358
Later. We have a duty
and duty comes before pleasure.

867
01:00:21,527 --> 01:00:25,520
Come and say goodbye to the man
who commands all our armies in Germany.

868
01:00:25,687 --> 01:00:30,283
Come on, come on. No sulks.
That's not the Roman way.

869
01:00:37,567 --> 01:00:40,001
- So you're leaving us?
- Yes, Caesar.

870
01:00:40,167 --> 01:00:41,486
And glad to go?

871
01:00:41,647 --> 01:00:45,276
I go where I'm sent, Caesar,
but, yes, I am glad to go.

872
01:00:45,447 --> 01:00:48,837
When I was your age,
I wanted to be with the army too.

873
01:00:49,007 --> 01:00:51,567
I brought Gaius and Lucius
to say goodbye.

874
01:00:51,727 --> 01:00:55,766
We've been playing Empire.
I've already lost Egypt and Syria.

875
01:00:55,927 --> 01:00:58,316
- May I ask Drusus a question?
- Go ahead.

876
01:00:58,487 --> 01:01:00,637
How many legions
could invade Britain?

877
01:01:03,087 --> 01:01:07,444
Four. Yes. And a great deal
of auxiliary cavalry as well

878
01:01:07,607 --> 01:01:10,167
Not three? They’re very uncivilised.

879
01:01:10,327 --> 01:01:11,999
It's not worth the risk.

880
01:01:12,167 --> 01:01:15,762
On a fresh venture,
you must hit hard and quickly.

881
01:01:15,927 --> 01:01:19,522
Sending for reinforcements
gives the enemy breathing space.

882
01:01:21,007 --> 01:01:22,599
I'll do it one day.

883
01:01:22,767 --> 01:01:24,837
I doubt it's worth it.

884
01:01:25,007 --> 01:01:28,636
There's nothing of value there
and the people make poor slaves.

885
01:01:30,087 --> 01:01:32,647
Say goodbye
and wait for me upstairs.

886
01:01:32,807 --> 01:01:34,718
- Goodbye, then.
- Goodbye.

887
01:01:34,887 --> 01:01:36,240
Goodbye.

888
01:01:37,967 --> 01:01:41,516
Read Julius' commentaries
on his campaign in Britain.

889
01:01:41,687 --> 01:01:44,155
- I've read it twice.
- So have I. Goodbye.

890
01:01:46,047 --> 01:01:50,040
Don't move the tokens
while I'm gone. I know where they are.

891
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:54,358
They’re good boys.
We'll have need of them one day.

892
01:01:54,527 --> 01:01:57,724
Come and walk with me
in the garden a moment.

893
01:01:57,887 --> 01:02:00,799
- Is Antonia travelling with you?
- Yes.

894
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:03,435
- That's all right in her condition?
- Yes.

895
01:02:03,607 --> 01:02:07,361
I didn't realise she was expecting
again. Julia told me.

896
01:02:07,527 --> 01:02:10,963
- It's a bit close to the others.
- Well. what can you do?

897
01:02:11,127 --> 01:02:14,961
True. Anyway, we need more children,
especially among the nobility.

898
01:02:15,127 --> 01:02:18,244
People aren't getting married
early enough.

899
01:02:18,407 --> 01:02:20,443
I must do something about that.

900
01:02:23,167 --> 01:02:25,727
Have you said goodbye to Livia?

901
01:02:25,887 --> 01:02:28,276
She's with the Parthian ambassador.

902
01:02:28,447 --> 01:02:32,838
Oh, yes. She works so hard for me.
Your mother is a very fine woman.

903
01:02:33,007 --> 01:02:35,885
I'd have given up long ago
if it weren't for her.

904
01:02:36,047 --> 01:02:39,722
It's an immense burden to place
on the shoulders of one man.

905
01:02:39,887 --> 01:02:43,323
Yes, it is. It's really too much.

906
01:02:43,487 --> 01:02:47,366
I sometimes have a longing
to be just a private citizen again.

907
01:02:47,527 --> 01:02:50,564
It's been 20 years now
since Mark Antony died

908
01:02:50,727 --> 01:02:54,197
and I took it all on my own.
I blame him, you know.

909
01:02:54,367 --> 01:02:58,155
What a fool that man was. The whole
of the Eastern Empire was his.

910
01:02:58,327 --> 01:03:02,320
If he'd been a proper husband
to my sister, things would be different.

911
01:03:02,487 --> 01:03:04,239
- Is it too late...?
- Yes?

912
01:03:04,407 --> 01:03:08,525
Is it too late to lay down
the burdens of office?

913
01:03:08,687 --> 01:03:10,882
- And let the Senate rule?
- Yes.

914
01:03:11,047 --> 01:03:15,006
You're just like your father.
Always wanting the Republic.

915
01:03:16,167 --> 01:03:18,317
He was my enemy too at one time.

916
01:03:21,007 --> 01:03:22,838
I'll never be that.

917
01:03:23,327 --> 01:03:24,680
No.

918
01:03:24,847 --> 01:03:29,443
No, I didn't mean that. Be like him,
you couldn't do better.

919
01:03:31,287 --> 01:03:34,438
I did him wrong once, you know.
Oh, yes, yes.

920
01:03:35,447 --> 01:03:37,597
I took your mother from him

921
01:03:37,767 --> 01:03:41,123
and that has weighed with me
over the years.

922
01:03:43,207 --> 01:03:45,562
Still. we're a family,

923
01:03:45,727 --> 01:03:50,323
and we all work together
for the greater good of Rome.

924
01:03:52,727 --> 01:03:54,445
My brother...

925
01:03:54,607 --> 01:03:56,916
Yes, yes, Tiberius.

926
01:03:57,087 --> 01:03:59,840
He's a puzzle to me,
like the Sphinx

927
01:04:00,007 --> 01:04:03,841
He's like a large dog watching
everything and saying nothing.

928
01:04:04,007 --> 01:04:08,000
- He wants to leave Rome.
- I know. But I need him here.

929
01:04:08,167 --> 01:04:10,442
What would I do without him?

930
01:04:10,607 --> 01:04:14,839
- Still. an unwilling horse...
- Is more trouble than walking.

931
01:04:15,007 --> 01:04:18,079
But we're not horses.
We can't all do what we want.

932
01:04:18,247 --> 01:04:21,637
And what does he want?. He wants
to sit on a rock all day -

933
01:04:21,807 --> 01:04:24,241
Rhodes or Capri -
and throw stones at the sea.

934
01:04:24,407 --> 01:04:27,399
Why?. I don't know.
No. We can't have it.

935
01:04:27,567 --> 01:04:29,319
Ah, here's your mother.

936
01:04:30,607 --> 01:04:33,121
- You're off again?
- Yes, Mother.

937
01:04:33,287 --> 01:04:38,077
You read the dispatches?
The Corusci are giving trouble again.

938
01:04:38,247 --> 01:04:39,999
I'll give them trouble enough.

939
01:04:40,167 --> 01:04:42,044
Shall we ever civilise the Germans?

940
01:04:42,207 --> 01:04:44,243
- I doubt it.
- You know how I feel

941
01:04:44,407 --> 01:04:47,126
When we conquer a people,
we must be temperate,

942
01:04:47,287 --> 01:04:51,246
but when agreements are broken,
punishments must be severe.

943
01:04:52,407 --> 01:04:54,284
What do the Parthians want?.

944
01:04:54,447 --> 01:04:56,597
They want a Roman god to worship.

945
01:04:56,767 --> 01:04:59,440
They want to dedicate a temple
to you.

946
01:04:59,607 --> 01:05:01,359
I won't have it.

947
01:05:01,527 --> 01:05:05,440
We've abolished kings in Rome.
Would you give us living gods?

948
01:05:05,607 --> 01:05:08,075
They won't be in Rome.
They’ll be in Syria.

949
01:05:08,247 --> 01:05:11,842
What harm is a temple built in your name
where primitive people...?

950
01:05:12,007 --> 01:05:17,127
No, it makes me uneasy, Livia.
I feel in my heart it's not right.

951
01:05:18,207 --> 01:05:22,325
We may offend those gods that look
after us and oversee our destiny.

952
01:05:22,487 --> 01:05:24,955
- But...
- No. You must tell them no.

953
01:05:26,607 --> 01:05:29,565
I must get back to the boys
and finish the game.

954
01:05:29,727 --> 01:05:33,276
Look after Antonia. No accidents.

955
01:05:33,447 --> 01:05:36,405
Who knows what great Roman
she may be carrying.

956
01:05:39,247 --> 01:05:41,238
The gods go with you.

957
01:05:44,047 --> 01:05:46,242
I shall ask the boys to dine
with us.

958
01:05:46,407 --> 01:05:49,843
They can listen to the discussion
with the ambassadors.

959
01:05:52,367 --> 01:05:56,246
Leave him alone. Don't encourage him
to step down from office.

960
01:05:56,407 --> 01:06:01,003
Mother, do you really want us
to drift into a hereditary monarchy?.

961
01:06:01,167 --> 01:06:04,045
Become corrupt
like the Eastern potentates?

962
01:06:04,207 --> 01:06:07,040
Rome will never be a republic again.

963
01:06:09,967 --> 01:06:12,117
Well. we needn't quarrel about it.

964
01:06:13,647 --> 01:06:15,638
Let me kiss you and say goodbye.

965
01:06:19,847 --> 01:06:22,486
You know, you mustn't mind
if you dislike me.

966
01:06:26,607 --> 01:06:29,440
A mother can't love
all her children.

967
01:06:36,807 --> 01:06:40,880
You shouldn't have come here.
It's wrong. It's wrong.

968
01:06:41,047 --> 01:06:43,641
Don't send me away.
Please, Vipsania.

969
01:06:43,807 --> 01:06:46,082
Do you want to make trouble for me?

970
01:06:46,247 --> 01:06:48,238
No. No.

971
01:06:48,407 --> 01:06:51,956
Then go away. It's dangerous.

972
01:06:53,287 --> 01:06:57,041
Open the shutter.
Let me look at you again.

973
01:07:04,647 --> 01:07:07,684
Please, please go away!

974
01:07:09,527 --> 01:07:11,404
Is it true?

975
01:07:13,407 --> 01:07:15,875
Yes. Yes, it's true.

976
01:07:16,687 --> 01:07:19,042
- You're getting married again.
- Yes.

977
01:07:21,527 --> 01:07:24,041
I won't have it. I won't have it!

978
01:07:24,607 --> 01:07:29,123
I'll kill you! You're mine!
You're my wife!

979
01:07:30,967 --> 01:07:34,243
I am not your wife. You divorced me.

980
01:07:36,287 --> 01:07:38,755
Don't... Don't.

981
01:07:38,927 --> 01:07:41,122
Please, you must leave me alone.

982
01:07:42,047 --> 01:07:44,083
We mustn't see each other again.

983
01:07:44,247 --> 01:07:46,203
- Do you love him?
- Do you love her?.

984
01:07:46,367 --> 01:07:48,358
No. No, I hate her.

985
01:07:51,327 --> 01:07:55,559
- He's very kind to me.
- But why must you marry again?

986
01:07:55,727 --> 01:08:00,084
I must put an end to your following me!
To your coming to see me!

987
01:08:00,247 --> 01:08:02,238
Your mother's spies are everywhere.

988
01:08:03,207 --> 01:08:05,004
I don't care about that!

989
01:08:05,167 --> 01:08:07,601
You're married to Augustus' daughter.

990
01:08:07,767 --> 01:08:09,598
You can't treat her like no one.

991
01:08:11,287 --> 01:08:14,518
Don't get married again, I beg you.

992
01:08:15,367 --> 01:08:17,119
I couldn't bear it.

993
01:08:17,287 --> 01:08:19,596
And spend the rest of my life alone?

994
01:08:19,767 --> 01:08:23,601
You wouldn't be alone,
I promise you.

995
01:08:23,767 --> 01:08:29,125
Tiberius, it was not my doing.
I didn't divorce you, you divorced me!

996
01:08:29,287 --> 01:08:31,118
I didn't want to.

997
01:08:32,087 --> 01:08:35,682
- They made me do it.
- They couldn't have made me!

998
01:08:38,687 --> 01:08:41,724
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.
I didn't mean that.

999
01:08:44,607 --> 01:08:46,916
It was hard for you, I know.

1000
01:08:47,087 --> 01:08:49,965
Harder for you
than it would have been for me.

1001
01:08:50,127 --> 01:08:54,279
I shouldn't have done it.
I should have killed myself first.

1002
01:08:54,447 --> 01:08:56,881
It's done now.
There's no going back.

1003
01:09:01,327 --> 01:09:03,318
Let's die together.

1004
01:09:05,607 --> 01:09:07,518
Let's kill ourselves.

1005
01:09:07,687 --> 01:09:11,805
Let's go into our bathroom,
open our veins,

1006
01:09:11,967 --> 01:09:16,882
and when they find us, our blood
will be mingling in the water.

1007
01:09:17,047 --> 01:09:21,723
Oh, my baby, my baby.
It's too late. It's too late.

1008
01:09:21,887 --> 01:09:26,961
I'm lost. I'm lost.
I go from darkness into darkness.

1009
01:09:27,127 --> 01:09:28,958
You'll come through it
and so will I.

1010
01:09:29,127 --> 01:09:33,723
How will I? I'm afraid
of what I'll become without you.

1011
01:09:33,887 --> 01:09:37,357
- Why should you be afraid?
- Because of your sweetness.

1012
01:09:38,967 --> 01:09:43,279
We had a delegation here six months
ago from Palmyra.

1013
01:09:43,447 --> 01:09:45,677
And Augustus refused, I remember.

1014
01:09:46,927 --> 01:09:50,442
The thought of deification
makes him uneasy.

1015
01:09:50,607 --> 01:09:52,723
It might make us all uneasy.

1016
01:09:52,887 --> 01:09:55,685
- We're not all worthy of it.
- No, of course.

1017
01:09:56,607 --> 01:09:58,643
But his mind is made up?

1018
01:09:59,527 --> 01:10:02,166
Yes, but so is mine.

1019
01:10:02,687 --> 01:10:06,680
I cannot allow his natural modesty

1020
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:09,315
to interfere
with his political judgement.

1021
01:10:09,487 --> 01:10:13,765
If the Senate thought that his
deification were politically useful.

1022
01:10:13,927 --> 01:10:16,157
he would not be displeased.

1023
01:10:17,367 --> 01:10:21,645
But he will exert no pressure
nor be present at the debates.

1024
01:10:21,807 --> 01:10:23,399
Of course.

1025
01:10:24,247 --> 01:10:26,158
There will be some opposition.

1026
01:10:27,007 --> 01:10:30,556
- But I'll take the line...
- I'll tell you what line to take.

1027
01:10:30,727 --> 01:10:33,366
You were seen!
And in broad daylight!

1028
01:10:33,527 --> 01:10:37,486
Going in and coming out. I won't
have it! It's not the first time!

1029
01:10:38,727 --> 01:10:40,558
I went to congratulate her.

1030
01:10:40,727 --> 01:10:44,606
Don't congratulate her! Leave her be!
You didn't go for that reason!

1031
01:10:44,767 --> 01:10:48,203
You'll treat my daughter
with respect! Do you hear me?!

1032
01:10:48,367 --> 01:10:50,961
I didn't ask for this marriage,
you asked for it!

1033
01:10:51,127 --> 01:10:53,197
I won't have it made a mockery of!

1034
01:10:53,367 --> 01:10:56,598
He's been seeing his former wife,
if you please!

1035
01:10:56,767 --> 01:10:59,839
- I think you exaggerate.
- I exaggerate nothing!

1036
01:11:00,007 --> 01:11:03,124
He met her on the street.
Yes, you did. I heard about it.

1037
01:11:03,287 --> 01:11:05,755
I hear everything.
Nothing escapes me.

1038
01:11:05,927 --> 01:11:07,838
He didn't dare speak to her,

1039
01:11:08,007 --> 01:11:12,364
but he followed her
like a moonstruck calf for everyone to see!

1040
01:11:13,847 --> 01:11:16,520
You will not make a laughing stock
of my family

1041
01:11:16,687 --> 01:11:20,157
or as quick as boiled asparagus,
I'll have you out! Out!

1042
01:11:25,967 --> 01:11:27,764
You listen to me.

1043
01:11:28,767 --> 01:11:30,997
Mark Antony was twice
the man you are,

1044
01:11:31,167 --> 01:11:33,044
but when he spa on my sister,

1045
01:11:33,207 --> 01:11:37,200
he learned a lesson he didn't
live long enough to profit from.

1046
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:39,479
Julia and I don't get on.

1047
01:11:39,647 --> 01:11:42,400
Damn you! You'll get on
whether you like it or not!

1048
01:11:42,567 --> 01:11:44,797
And you'll leave that woman alone!

1049
01:11:44,967 --> 01:11:46,958
Let me go away. Let me leave Rome.

1050
01:11:48,287 --> 01:11:50,278
What am I to do with him?

1051
01:11:50,447 --> 01:11:54,440
Tell me. You're his mother, speak
to him. It's Agrippa all over again.

1052
01:11:54,607 --> 01:11:57,167
He doesn't mean it.
He doesn't want to go.

1053
01:11:57,327 --> 01:11:59,204
Didn't you hear what he said?!

1054
01:11:59,367 --> 01:12:02,040
He's unhappy. He didn't mean it.

1055
01:12:03,247 --> 01:12:07,365
It's not unnatural for a man
to see his former wife now and then.

1056
01:12:07,527 --> 01:12:12,555
I saw his father several times
after you and I were married.

1057
01:12:12,727 --> 01:12:14,877
- That was different.
- Not so different.

1058
01:12:15,047 --> 01:12:17,880
And you saw Julia's mother
from time to time.

1059
01:12:18,047 --> 01:12:21,642
- Yes, but not in secret!
- I don't remember being present.

1060
01:12:21,807 --> 01:12:24,082
Maybe not, but it was not in secret!

1061
01:12:24,247 --> 01:12:27,717
Well. how secret was this?
I knew about it.

1062
01:12:31,527 --> 01:12:36,078
- You knew about it?.
- Of course. He told me.

1063
01:12:36,247 --> 01:12:38,124
You never said anything to me.

1064
01:12:38,287 --> 01:12:40,960
Have you so little
to occupy your time

1065
01:12:41,127 --> 01:12:44,085
that I must tell you
about everyone in the household?

1066
01:12:45,007 --> 01:12:49,285
You're always complaining that
you have too much to think about.

1067
01:12:49,447 --> 01:12:52,757
Perhaps you'd care to see
the laundry lists in future?

1068
01:13:05,607 --> 01:13:07,882
All right. I was hasty.

1069
01:13:08,447 --> 01:13:12,122
But you understand
I felt I had cause!

1070
01:13:14,647 --> 01:13:17,957
Tiberius, listen. I'm not blind.

1071
01:13:18,127 --> 01:13:22,279
I know that you and Julia aren't
the most perfectly-matched couple,

1072
01:13:22,447 --> 01:13:25,041
but what can you do?
These things happen.

1073
01:13:25,207 --> 01:13:27,960
We can't cut the knot every time
we quarrel

1074
01:13:28,127 --> 01:13:32,325
Especially us. We have to set
an example. Livia, you'll back me.

1075
01:13:32,487 --> 01:13:37,083
Of course. We have duties which far
outweigh our private feelings.

1076
01:13:37,247 --> 01:13:38,600
Exactly.

1077
01:13:40,847 --> 01:13:46,240
Now, Tiberius, you play fair
with me, eh? Don't sulk.

1078
01:13:48,407 --> 01:13:52,685
If it's a little thing on the side -
I'm not encouraging - who's to know?.

1079
01:13:52,847 --> 01:13:57,841
Forgetting that your mother's here -
if that's ever possible!

1080
01:13:58,847 --> 01:14:02,522
Yes. Well. we can wink at it
between men.

1081
01:14:03,407 --> 01:14:04,965
But Vipsania...

1082
01:14:05,127 --> 01:14:08,164
I don't like it, do you understand?
It's not right.

1083
01:14:09,007 --> 01:14:13,205
You play fair with me
and you'll see I can be generous too.

1084
01:14:15,727 --> 01:14:17,126
Good.

1085
01:14:18,847 --> 01:14:20,200
Good.

1086
01:14:22,687 --> 01:14:25,565
If there's one thing I hate,
it's a family row.

1087
01:14:25,727 --> 01:14:29,640
What does it cost to be kind?
To be sympathetic and understanding.

1088
01:14:30,167 --> 01:14:31,520
Yes?

1089
01:14:31,687 --> 01:14:34,121
A messenger has arrived
from Germany, Caesar.

1090
01:14:34,287 --> 01:14:35,800
Send him in.

1091
01:14:39,607 --> 01:14:42,599
A dispatch from Drusus Nero
for his noble brother.

1092
01:14:42,767 --> 01:14:45,679
Tiberius, let's hear what he says.

1093
01:14:55,527 --> 01:15:01,204
"My dear Tiberius, a period of enforced rest
due to a slight head wound

1094
01:15:01,367 --> 01:15:06,361
"has given me much time to reflect
on the state of our beloved Rome."

1095
01:15:06,527 --> 01:15:09,519
- He's wounded. Not seriously?.
- He says slight.

1096
01:15:10,847 --> 01:15:15,363
"Such was the extent
of the corruption that I found in..."

1097
01:15:18,807 --> 01:15:20,206
Go on.

1098
01:15:22,727 --> 01:15:24,604
The handwriting is...

1099
01:15:25,287 --> 01:15:27,755
Surely you can read more than that?.

1100
01:15:27,927 --> 01:15:31,397
Yes. Well. he goes on to say err...

1101
01:15:33,767 --> 01:15:35,086
Well?.

1102
01:15:36,527 --> 01:15:39,325
Honestly, sir,
it's not worth reading.

1103
01:15:39,487 --> 01:15:43,116
I think my brother was perhaps
not himself when he wrote it.

1104
01:16:02,407 --> 01:16:06,116
"..The corruption and petty place
seeking that I found in Rome.

1105
01:16:06,287 --> 01:16:09,962
"I have come to the conclusion
that it is the consequence

1106
01:16:10,127 --> 01:16:13,642
"of the continued exercise
of supreme power by Augustus.

1107
01:16:16,807 --> 01:16:21,517
"Could we not persuade him,
even compel him to retire?

1108
01:16:22,687 --> 01:16:25,201
"I firmly believe
he is ready to do this,

1109
01:16:25,367 --> 01:16:28,643
"but for the stubbornness
of our mother Livia,

1110
01:16:28,807 --> 01:16:30,798
"who derives such satisfaction

1111
01:16:31,087 --> 01:16:34,079
"from the exercise of supreme power
through him..."

1112
01:16:37,247 --> 01:16:40,717
There's more.
Do you want to read it?.

1113
01:16:42,087 --> 01:16:44,078
The letter's clearly treasonable.

1114
01:16:44,247 --> 01:16:48,445
No, no. He feels strongly about it.
I understand that.

1115
01:16:48,607 --> 01:16:52,043
He's wrong, but I understand it.

1116
01:16:55,567 --> 01:16:58,684
Then again, perhaps he's right.

1117
01:16:59,847 --> 01:17:03,760
Perhaps I should retire.
I've said so often enough.

1118
01:17:06,727 --> 01:17:09,036
Will you allow him to insult me?

1119
01:17:09,207 --> 01:17:11,038
He's your son, not mine!

1120
01:17:12,487 --> 01:17:16,799
His wound might have affected him.
He speaks of giddiness at the end.

1121
01:17:17,847 --> 01:17:19,166
Yes.

1122
01:17:21,567 --> 01:17:24,206
Yes. That's it.

1123
01:17:25,847 --> 01:17:27,838
He's a little bit deranged.

1124
01:17:28,967 --> 01:17:31,561
Those German forests
can affect a man.

1125
01:17:33,047 --> 01:17:36,756
I'll call him back for a rest.
It'll be good to see him again.

1126
01:17:36,927 --> 01:17:39,361
Yes, you're right.
We should have him back.

1127
01:17:39,527 --> 01:17:41,995
I'll send a doctor with the letter.

1128
01:17:42,167 --> 01:17:45,045
- He's got a doctor.
- Army doctors! What do they know?.

1129
01:17:45,207 --> 01:17:48,882
I'll send my own.
He'll know how to take care of him.

1130
01:17:55,567 --> 01:17:56,966
Easy.

1131
01:17:57,127 --> 01:17:59,357
That's right. Fetch the doctor.

1132
01:18:00,087 --> 01:18:02,726
- Which one?
- Ours, of course, and hurry.

1133
01:18:02,887 --> 01:18:07,085
Lift him onto the table and be
careful or I'll make eunuchs of you!

1134
01:18:07,767 --> 01:18:11,442
You blockheads!
Right. Get this away.

1135
01:18:13,047 --> 01:18:14,878
I'll have the lot of you crucified.

1136
01:18:16,567 --> 01:18:18,478
It's all right. It's all right.

1137
01:18:18,647 --> 01:18:20,080
All right. Clear out.

1138
01:18:21,607 --> 01:18:23,438
It feels terrible.

1139
01:18:23,607 --> 01:18:26,201
It's a mess. We'll get it cleaned.

1140
01:18:26,847 --> 01:18:28,644
Hurry up with that water!

1141
01:18:30,807 --> 01:18:32,286
What happened?

1142
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:34,756
My horse fell on me.
I couldn't get out.

1143
01:18:34,927 --> 01:18:38,920
It crushed my leg on a rock,
then tore it to shreds getting up.

1144
01:18:39,687 --> 01:18:43,396
- The doctor's coming.
- What did they mean - "Which one"?

1145
01:18:43,567 --> 01:18:47,196
One arrived from Rome.
He's your mother's personal physician.

1146
01:18:49,687 --> 01:18:54,283
That was kind of her. He'll have
more to look at. Where is he?

1147
01:18:54,447 --> 01:18:57,280
We found him a room.
He doesn't look too happy.

1148
01:18:57,447 --> 01:19:00,120
He's already missing
the comforts of home.

1149
01:19:04,847 --> 01:19:06,883
This will probably hurt.

1150
01:19:12,927 --> 01:19:15,680
He brought a letter with him
from Caesar.

1151
01:19:15,847 --> 01:19:18,964
- Where is it?.
- I'll give it to you after.

1152
01:19:19,127 --> 01:19:21,083
Give it to me now!

1153
01:19:29,127 --> 01:19:30,526
Rufus?

1154
01:19:32,567 --> 01:19:35,684
- What happened?
- A horse fell and crushed his leg.

1155
01:19:43,207 --> 01:19:45,767
- Oh...
- No, no, I'm all right.

1156
01:19:47,967 --> 01:19:50,879
I've been invited, politely,
back to Rome.

1157
01:19:51,047 --> 01:19:54,756
- Why?.
- I'm not sure, but I can guess.

1158
01:19:56,567 --> 01:19:59,081
Oh! Get out of here!

1159
01:20:05,687 --> 01:20:09,760
You'll not be moving far on that leg,
if I'm any judge of wounds.

1160
01:20:12,767 --> 01:20:14,803
I don't understand it.

1161
01:20:15,727 --> 01:20:17,445
A simple fall

1162
01:20:17,607 --> 01:20:21,282
- How could it happen?
- They can be bad sometimes.

1163
01:20:21,447 --> 01:20:26,077
- To bring him to death's door.
- It's an excuse for not returning.

1164
01:20:26,247 --> 01:20:28,044
Why do you say that?.

1165
01:20:28,207 --> 01:20:31,483
I've heard such reasons before.
Don't raise your voice to me.

1166
01:20:31,647 --> 01:20:34,480
- What reason could he have?
- Who knows?

1167
01:20:34,647 --> 01:20:37,957
We know he has the whole
of the western armies at his back.

1168
01:20:38,127 --> 01:20:40,163
He'll come when it suits him.

1169
01:20:41,727 --> 01:20:43,399
I must go to my brother.

1170
01:20:43,567 --> 01:20:47,480
He's 500 miles away.
He could be dead even now.

1171
01:20:47,647 --> 01:20:49,638
All the same, I must go to him.

1172
01:20:50,687 --> 01:20:53,360
I'll make a sacrifice
and offer prayers.

1173
01:20:53,527 --> 01:20:55,802
Perhaps he won't be taken from us.

1174
01:20:56,407 --> 01:20:58,125
Take him our love.

1175
01:21:00,247 --> 01:21:02,397
Well. go, go quickly!

1176
01:21:09,487 --> 01:21:13,366
The Senate today voted
to make me a god in Palmyra.

1177
01:21:14,367 --> 01:21:17,040
They’ll put a little statue to me
in the temple

1178
01:21:17,207 --> 01:21:20,358
and people will bring offerings
asking me to bring rain

1179
01:21:20,527 --> 01:21:22,757
or cure their father's gout.

1180
01:21:23,847 --> 01:21:28,682
Tell me, Livia, if I'm a god -
even in Palmyra...

1181
01:21:29,807 --> 01:21:31,843
how do I cure gout?.

1182
01:21:38,967 --> 01:21:43,245
What is it, my love? What do you want?.

1183
01:21:46,247 --> 01:21:48,807
Fetch the children.

1184
01:21:50,007 --> 01:21:53,716
Yes. Yes, of course.

1185
01:21:55,127 --> 01:21:57,004
I'll bring them.

1186
01:22:04,607 --> 01:22:06,837
He wants me to fetch the children.

1187
01:22:21,567 --> 01:22:24,604
- Is he...?
- No. But it's near.

1188
01:22:36,927 --> 01:22:39,964
- What is it?.
- Gangrene.

1189
01:22:41,007 --> 01:22:43,999
It crept slowly up.
Nothing seamed to stop it.

1190
01:22:45,367 --> 01:22:47,198
Where's the staff surgeon?

1191
01:22:47,367 --> 01:22:52,077
He wasn't allowed near him.
He took the case out of his hands.

1192
01:23:10,047 --> 01:23:11,366
Musar.

1193
01:23:12,847 --> 01:23:14,838
It was just a simple fall

1194
01:23:16,087 --> 01:23:18,362
What happened to your skill?.

1195
01:23:18,527 --> 01:23:21,360
I...I came too late.

1196
01:23:21,527 --> 01:23:25,520
His condition was too far gone.
I came too late.

1197
01:23:34,807 --> 01:23:36,160
Drusus?

1198
01:23:36,327 --> 01:23:38,238
Drusus, look at me.

1199
01:23:38,407 --> 01:23:42,844
Drusus, it's I, Tiberius.

1200
01:23:48,287 --> 01:23:51,563
You and your damned plum stones.

1201
01:23:55,767 --> 01:23:57,644
She read the letter.

1202
01:23:58,727 --> 01:24:00,524
I couldn't stop her.

1203
01:24:01,927 --> 01:24:03,918
She was there when I got it.

1204
01:24:05,087 --> 01:24:08,284
I couldn't think
it would have anything in it.

1205
01:24:10,927 --> 01:24:14,283
Rome has a severe mother.

1206
01:24:16,607 --> 01:24:20,122
And Gaius and Lucius...

1207
01:24:22,287 --> 01:24:24,357
a cruel stepmother.

1208
01:24:33,687 --> 01:24:35,279
Drusus...?

1209
01:24:36,767 --> 01:24:38,086
Drusus...?

1210
01:24:38,727 --> 01:24:40,046
Drusus!

1211
01:24:41,607 --> 01:24:43,165
No.

1212
01:24:44,167 --> 01:24:45,520
No.

1213

(BABY CRIES)

1214
01:24:53,527 --> 01:24:55,563
You didn't wait.

1215
01:24:56,607 --> 01:24:58,404
You didn't wait.

1216
01:24:58,567 --> 01:25:02,116
Look. I brought you little Claudius.

1217
01:25:05,647 --> 01:25:07,524
And you didn't wait.

1218
01:25:16,727 --> 01:25:20,083
Shouldn't have died
and that's a fact

1219
01:25:21,047 --> 01:25:24,278
Somebody blundered,
and that's a fact

1220

(KNOCKING)

1221
01:25:27,247 --> 01:25:28,680
Come.

1222
01:25:31,487 --> 01:25:33,717
Your meal is ready, Caesar.

1223
01:25:58,607 --> 01:26:01,280
Will you have it now
or shall I take it away?.

1224
01:26:34,847 --> 01:26:38,362
Very good. I think the cook's
on form today, for a change.

1225
01:26:38,527 --> 01:26:40,040
Try that.

1226
01:26:41,727 --> 01:26:43,206
There.

1227
01:26:50,727 --> 01:26:53,195
The garlic's overdone for my taste.

1228
01:26:53,367 --> 01:26:56,564
You're always complaining
about the g-garlic.

1229
01:26:56,727 --> 01:26:58,126
Go on.

1230
01:27:05,007 --> 01:27:07,157
A good swallow now.

1231
01:27:15,607 --> 01:27:19,600
Yes, I know this one. It's from
the north. About five years old.

1232
01:27:19,767 --> 01:27:23,521
They had a bad summer.
The grapes had less sugar in them.

1233
01:27:23,727 --> 01:27:28,562
Oh, stop showing off.
Well. fill it up, then you can go.

1234
01:27:28,727 --> 01:27:30,240
I'm very busy.

1235
01:27:30,407 --> 01:27:32,637
- Another history, Caesar?.
- Yes.

1236
01:27:32,807 --> 01:27:36,356
- Of the Etruscans again?
- No, of my family.

1237
01:27:38,487 --> 01:27:41,320
Did you ever read my history
of the Etruscans?

1238
01:27:41,487 --> 01:27:46,277
No. I got it down from the library once,
but I couldn't get into it.

1239
01:27:46,447 --> 01:27:49,086
Very well written, of course.
Very well

1240
01:27:49,967 --> 01:27:51,958
Is something the matter, Caesar?.

1241
01:27:52,127 --> 01:27:56,484
The fact is, when you know that
someone's trying to poison you,

1242
01:27:56,647 --> 01:27:59,957
nothing tastes right,
absolutely nothing.

1243
01:28:00,127 --> 01:28:02,721
Come now, who would want
to poison you, Caesar?.

1244
01:28:02,887 --> 01:28:06,084
Don't butter me up! You know
who'd want to poison me.

1245
01:28:06,247 --> 01:28:09,717
My wife, that's who,
and that slimy son of hers.

1246
01:28:10,687 --> 01:28:13,201
For all I know,
you're in league with them.

1247
01:28:14,327 --> 01:28:19,196
In my opinion, the only person
likely to poison us is the cook.

1248
01:28:19,367 --> 01:28:21,437
I wish you'd let me get rid of him.

1249
01:28:21,607 --> 01:28:26,965
He's a Greek and the only thing
he does is stuff vine leaves.

1250
01:28:27,127 --> 01:28:29,436
Will you take it away?.
I'm not hungry.

1251
01:28:35,327 --> 01:28:38,603
May I ask how the current work
is coming?

1252
01:28:38,767 --> 01:28:40,439
Well enough.

1253
01:28:47,447 --> 01:28:50,086
May I ask how far you've got?.

1254
01:28:50,247 --> 01:28:51,999
The death of my father.

1255
01:28:52,167 --> 01:28:54,237
Ah, the noble Drusus.

1256
01:28:54,407 --> 01:28:58,116
A tragedy that one should lose
one's father so young.

1257
01:28:58,287 --> 01:29:00,562
- Yes!
- Yes.

1258
01:29:11,687 --> 01:29:13,723
A tragedy for us all

1259
01:29:13,887 --> 01:29:16,117
Yes, and for Rome.

1260
01:29:16,287 --> 01:29:18,642
And especially for my uncle.

1261
01:29:18,807 --> 01:29:21,002
He was never the same again.

(MELANCHOLY PIPE PLAYS)

1263
01:30:13,207 --> 01:30:17,041
Well. sons of Agrippa...

1264
01:30:18,447 --> 01:30:21,678
The daylight's fled
and stars are out.

1265
01:30:22,847 --> 01:30:28,683
It's time for decent people
to lock their doors and go to sleep.

1266
01:30:29,527 --> 01:30:31,006
Come.

1267
01:30:31,167 --> 01:30:34,762
Come on. You can see me to my bed...

1268
01:30:36,127 --> 01:30:38,038
and then go to your own.

1269
01:30:45,927 --> 01:30:48,725
Yes, we've eaten well
and drunk well

1270
01:30:49,607 --> 01:30:51,723
Too well perhaps.

1271
01:30:58,087 --> 01:31:01,875
Poor Julia. She can't take the wine
as she used to.

1272
01:31:03,087 --> 01:31:06,238
And even dear Antonia nods a little.

1273
01:31:06,407 --> 01:31:07,806
What...?

1274
01:31:08,887 --> 01:31:11,401
What were you thinking tonight,
my dear?.

1275
01:31:12,567 --> 01:31:15,206
Ah, of poor Drusus.

1276
01:31:16,327 --> 01:31:21,321
Yes, yes, I was thinking of him
tonight too.

1277
01:31:24,047 --> 01:31:27,483
Rome cannot afford such a loss.

1278
01:31:31,487 --> 01:31:37,801
I pray to the Gods that these boys
will be as noble and virtuous as he was.

1279
01:31:40,847 --> 01:31:44,317
You mustn't dwell on it.
A year has gone by.

1280
01:31:44,487 --> 01:31:46,762
That's quite long enough for grief.

1281
01:31:46,927 --> 01:31:50,681
More is not the Roman way, you know.

1282
01:31:54,487 --> 01:31:56,796
Musicians, play us out.

1283
01:31:56,967 --> 01:31:59,879
Let us have music to take us
to our sleep.

1284
01:32:04,367 --> 01:32:05,800
A year?.

1285
01:32:07,647 --> 01:32:09,683
Is that all it is?

1286
01:32:12,167 --> 01:32:14,044
One little year?.

1287
01:32:22,487 --> 01:32:24,079
Goodnight, Lady.

(JULIA SNORES)

1289
01:32:35,447 --> 01:32:37,358
Pretty sight, isn't she?

1290
01:32:39,727 --> 01:32:44,118
I must get away from her.
I must leave Rome.

1291
01:32:45,287 --> 01:32:46,879
You'll stay.

1292
01:32:47,967 --> 01:32:51,437
You'll have patience, as I have.

1293
01:32:51,767 --> 01:32:54,361
Where has your patience got you?

1294
01:32:54,527 --> 01:32:57,041
You've lost him, Mother.

1295
01:32:57,967 --> 01:33:01,676
You've lost him to those two boys.

1296
01:33:01,967 --> 01:33:08,600
If you leave Rome, I'll wash my hands
of you once and for all

1297
01:33:08,767 --> 01:33:11,964
and shed not a single tear.

1298
01:33:12,127 --> 01:33:17,326
That's not surprising.
I saw you shed none for my brother.

1299
01:33:43,327 --> 01:33:45,238
Have they all gone?

1300
01:33:50,287 --> 01:33:54,200
Oh, Tiberius, I was having
such a beautiful dream.

1301
01:33:58,647 --> 01:34:00,638
Tiberius...

1302
01:34:02,767 --> 01:34:06,680
Sleep with me tonight.
I'll be so loving to you.

1303
01:34:08,047 --> 01:34:09,605
Be nice to me.

1304
01:34:09,767 --> 01:34:12,725
Oh, just tonight.

1305
01:34:12,887 --> 01:34:16,675
Let me go, you fat drunken cow!

1306
01:34:16,927 --> 01:34:18,360
Fat?. !

1307
01:34:18,527 --> 01:34:19,960
Fat?. !

1308
01:34:20,367 --> 01:34:24,804
I'm fat where a woman should be fat,
not skinny like a boy!

1309
01:34:24,967 --> 01:34:27,959
Go to bed, my dear,
and I'll send you one up.

1310
01:34:28,127 --> 01:34:31,802
He's very pretty, I promise you.
I've had him myself.

1311
01:34:33,887 --> 01:34:36,685
He reminds me of your ex-wife.

1312
01:34:36,967 --> 01:34:40,926
Not a hair on his body
and his even skinnier behind!

1313
01:34:41,687 --> 01:34:43,723
There'll be no divorce. None!

1314
01:34:43,887 --> 01:34:46,321
I don't care what he is.
You married him.

1315
01:34:46,487 --> 01:34:48,842
Look what your son did
to my daughter.

1316
01:34:49,007 --> 01:34:52,363
What kind of a man is that?.
I've never liked him, never.

1317
01:34:52,527 --> 01:34:55,166
He's your son,
but I've never liked him.

1318
01:34:55,327 --> 01:34:58,239
- I want a divorce!
- No divorce!

1319
01:34:58,407 --> 01:35:00,796
You've been married three times
already!

1320
01:35:00,967 --> 01:35:03,356
That's not my fault!
I was widowed twice!

1321
01:35:03,527 --> 01:35:05,916
How can a woman get herself
widowed twice?

1322
01:35:06,087 --> 01:35:08,965
- That's not fair!
- It shows damn poor judgment!

1323
01:35:09,127 --> 01:35:10,879
I never asked to marry Agrippa!

1324
01:35:11,047 --> 01:35:13,436
Well. you asked to marry this one!

1325
01:35:13,607 --> 01:35:16,440
That husband of yours
can clear out of Rome.

1326
01:35:16,607 --> 01:35:19,405
Tell him to go.
I don't even want to see him.

1327
01:35:19,567 --> 01:35:21,956
I don't want his name mentioned
in this house!

1328
01:35:22,127 --> 01:35:25,403
How am I supposed to live,
neither married nor divorced?

1329
01:35:25,567 --> 01:35:27,797
You'll live as befits
a Roman matron.

1330
01:35:27,967 --> 01:35:29,958
And heaven help you if you don't!

1331
01:35:33,967 --> 01:35:35,764
Oh, I don't know.

1332
01:35:37,447 --> 01:35:41,122
Why can't they get on?
What do they want from life?

1333
01:35:41,287 --> 01:35:45,166
I'm supposed to rule an empire
and I can't rule my own family.

1334
01:35:46,207 --> 01:35:49,643
Thank God for these boys.
You'll help me, won't you?

1335
01:35:49,807 --> 01:35:54,722
What would we do without Agrippa's
sons, Livia? They’re our one hope.

1336
01:35:57,407 --> 01:36:02,276
In three or four years, they’ll be
able to take some of this burden.

1337
01:36:03,007 --> 01:36:06,716
They’re promising, all right.
Aren't you, my beauties?

1338
01:36:06,887 --> 01:36:08,479
Very promising.

1339
01:36:09,767 --> 01:36:13,919
Still. you've a long way to go,
haven't you?

1340
01:36:14,087 --> 01:36:17,284
A long, long way.

1341
01:36:19,127 --> 01:36:21,800
We must take good care of them,
Augustus.

1342
01:36:21,967 --> 01:36:24,356
And we shall. I promise you.

1343
01:36:24,527 --> 01:36:27,087
The very best of care.

1344
01:36:28,327 --> 01:36:31,364
Ah, that's how it should be.

1345
01:36:31,527 --> 01:36:34,121
Stay like that a moment.
What a picture you make.

1346
01:36:34,287 --> 01:36:37,438
It expresses the true spirit
of the Roman family.
