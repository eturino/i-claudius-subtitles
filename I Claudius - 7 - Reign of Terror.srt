1
00:00:55,047 --> 00:00:59,643
With the death of Livia the last
restraint on Tiberius was removed.

2
00:00:59,807 --> 00:01:03,482
He handed the running
of the Empire over to Sejanus

3
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:05,478
and retired to Capri.

4
00:01:05,647 --> 00:01:09,037
A reign of terror began.
No one was safe.

5
00:01:10,887 --> 00:01:12,240
Oh.

6
00:01:22,807 --> 00:01:25,480
Sejanus arrested Agrippina,

7
00:01:25,647 --> 00:01:29,162
her eldest son, Nero,
and countless others besides

8
00:01:29,327 --> 00:01:31,318
His ambition was limitless

9
00:01:31,487 --> 00:01:33,762
He had divorced his wife...

10
00:01:37,487 --> 00:01:39,523
Apicata.

11
00:01:41,127 --> 00:01:43,766
..and become my sister's..

12
00:01:43,927 --> 00:01:46,077
Livilla's.

13
00:01:47,287 --> 00:01:50,484
..lover - hoping to marry her.

14
00:01:51,047 --> 00:01:54,926
My mother remained curiously
innocent of much that was going on,

15
00:01:55,087 --> 00:01:58,682
until one day,
Apicata came to visit her.

16
00:01:58,847 --> 00:02:03,125
Sejanus had taken their children with him
and Apicata wanted them back.

17
00:02:03,287 --> 00:02:07,326
She feared my sister would harm them
once married to Sejanus

18
00:02:07,487 --> 00:02:10,524
Now she demanded that my mother
speak to my sister

19
00:02:10,687 --> 00:02:12,598
and enlist her help.

20
00:02:14,527 --> 00:02:18,759
Will you speak to her?. Ask her
to persuade him to let me have them?

21
00:02:18,927 --> 00:02:23,557
To her, they’re a nuisance -
they’ll only come between him and her -

22
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:27,402
but to me they are everything.
Everything.

23
00:02:27,567 --> 00:02:29,000
Understand this.

24
00:02:29,167 --> 00:02:33,319
Though my daughter lives in my house,
we are not on friendly terms.

25
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:36,160
I despise her
though she is my daughter

26
00:02:36,327 --> 00:02:38,318
and I'll ask no favour of her.

27
00:02:38,487 --> 00:02:42,002
I despise that man who is her lover,
and you too I despise

28
00:02:42,167 --> 00:02:44,727
for having married him
knowing what he was.

29
00:02:44,887 --> 00:02:49,005
And now you complain
because he treats you as he treats others!

30
00:02:49,167 --> 00:02:51,317
You disgust me, all of you!

31
00:02:51,487 --> 00:02:54,479
You and people like you
have made a sewer of Rome,

32
00:02:54,647 --> 00:02:56,603
fit only for rats to live in!

33
00:02:56,767 --> 00:03:00,316
Honour, service,
duty mean nothing any more.

34
00:03:00,487 --> 00:03:03,285
Your children are everything?
What of Rome?

35
00:03:03,447 --> 00:03:05,483
All you are you owe to Rome.

36
00:03:05,647 --> 00:03:10,004
But you've destroyed it with goody
ambition and petty selfishness.

37
00:03:10,167 --> 00:03:13,921
Well. enjoy what you've made of it,
but don't come crying to me!

38
00:03:15,367 --> 00:03:19,280
I didn't come here to talk of Rome,
but of my children.

39
00:03:19,447 --> 00:03:23,326
Rome can sink. I want my children!

40
00:03:24,007 --> 00:03:26,077
And if you won't help me freely,

41
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:29,842
I must tell you something, Lady,
that may compel you.

42
00:03:31,927 --> 00:03:34,999
I told you I knew much
and more besides.

43
00:03:35,167 --> 00:03:37,158
Well. here it is.

44
00:03:37,327 --> 00:03:40,797
Your daughter's husband
died no natural death.

45
00:03:40,967 --> 00:03:43,720
Castor was murdered
by your daughter.

46
00:03:43,887 --> 00:03:47,163
Sejanus supplied the poison
but she fed it to him.

47
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:50,478
That guilty pair
are set upon a course

48
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:54,640
that will lead them to a kingly crown -
they want nothing less.

49
00:03:55,967 --> 00:03:58,720
If I go to Tiberius with this story,

50
00:03:58,887 --> 00:04:02,721
what then becomes
of your precious family name?

51
00:04:03,927 --> 00:04:05,918
You're lying.

52
00:04:06,607 --> 00:04:08,040
No.

53
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:11,044
What proof have you?

54
00:04:11,207 --> 00:04:16,122
Slaves that will talk freely,
or under torture, of things seen.

55
00:04:16,287 --> 00:04:18,243
Why haven't you been to the Emperor?.

56
00:04:18,407 --> 00:04:22,844
Sejanus has the sorting of his mail
and the sifting of his visitors.

57
00:04:23,807 --> 00:04:28,164
To get to Tiberius would cost me
my life and that's my last resort.

58
00:04:28,327 --> 00:04:31,637
He reads people's wills
when they leave everything to him.

59
00:04:31,807 --> 00:04:33,957
Not even Sejanus can prevent that.

60
00:04:34,127 --> 00:04:37,915
And if need be,
that's the course I'll follow.

61
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:44,000
Without my children,
my life is nothing.

62
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:47,964
Think carefully,
Mark Antony's daughter.

63
00:04:48,127 --> 00:04:50,118
Guard your family name.

64
00:04:50,287 --> 00:04:53,324
Let the lovers have their crown,
what is that to us?

65
00:04:54,207 --> 00:04:56,801
But get me back my children!

66
00:05:05,567 --> 00:05:11,358
Well. she certainly
l-l-loves her children.

67
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:15,885
Oh, you fool!
Is that all you can find to say?.

68
00:05:16,047 --> 00:05:18,561
What else do you w=want me to say?.

69
00:05:18,847 --> 00:05:22,442
- Do you believe her?.
- N-n-no!

70
00:05:22,607 --> 00:05:25,917
Not a word of it. She's demented.
Her mind's unhinged.

71
00:05:26,087 --> 00:05:30,080
Livilla's done some pretty
d-dreadful things in her time,

72
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:32,442
but I can't believe she'd do that.

73
00:05:32,607 --> 00:05:34,199
What dreadful things?

74
00:05:34,927 --> 00:05:36,565
Oh, err, things.

75
00:05:38,207 --> 00:05:43,918
She connived at the b-banishment
of Postumus. Ah, well. you know.

76
00:05:45,047 --> 00:05:48,164
No, I didn't know. How?.

77
00:05:51,247 --> 00:05:53,920
Why wasn't I told?

78
00:05:55,367 --> 00:05:56,846
Well..

79
00:05:57,007 --> 00:06:02,240
It was all a s-secret.
I'm the only one that knows.

80
00:06:02,407 --> 00:06:06,719
I think L-Livia m-m-made her do it.

81
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:12,917
And why was it a secret from me
and not from you?

82
00:06:16,607 --> 00:06:20,600
It's a l-l-long story, Mother.

83
00:06:20,767 --> 00:06:23,520
Well. what am I to do now?.

84
00:06:23,687 --> 00:06:26,281
We shall find someone else
for you to marry.

85
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:28,998
Stop blubbering, child!

86
00:06:29,167 --> 00:06:32,204
Do you think affairs of state
take account of your plans?

87
00:06:32,367 --> 00:06:34,278
(KNOCKING)
What is it?.

88
00:06:36,967 --> 00:06:39,800
She's crying
because she can't now marry Nero.

89
00:06:39,967 --> 00:06:42,640
I've told her
we shall find someone else.

90
00:06:42,807 --> 00:06:46,436
Is that all you can think of -
your own thwarted pleasures?

91
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:48,598
You'd better pray for his safety.

92
00:06:48,767 --> 00:06:51,042
Leave us.
I want to talk to your mother.

93
00:06:51,207 --> 00:06:53,198
She thinks of nothing but marriage.

94
00:06:55,407 --> 00:06:57,398
And what do you think of?.

95
00:06:59,687 --> 00:07:01,598
What does that mean?

96
00:07:01,767 --> 00:07:04,600
Is it true you intend
to marry Aelius Sejanus?

97
00:07:07,367 --> 00:07:10,165
- You've been talking to someone.
- Is it true?

98
00:07:12,247 --> 00:07:14,442
He's asked me to marry him, yes.

99
00:07:15,407 --> 00:07:19,241
And I've accepted.
Why not?. I'm tired of living alone.

100
00:07:19,407 --> 00:07:22,877
- Do you live alone?
- You see that I live alone.

101
00:07:23,047 --> 00:07:25,800
I don't keep track
of your comings and goings.

102
00:07:27,407 --> 00:07:29,967
I am still a young woman, Mother.

103
00:07:31,047 --> 00:07:33,436
Castor died nearly five years ago.

104
00:07:33,607 --> 00:07:35,962
You can't expect me
to live like a Vestal

105
00:07:36,127 --> 00:07:38,641
I'm not talking
of whose bed you climb in.

106
00:07:38,807 --> 00:07:43,244
How you dispose of your body
is your affair, but marriage is different.

107
00:07:43,407 --> 00:07:46,604
Do I need to remind you
whose child you are?

108
00:07:47,807 --> 00:07:50,480
I am in love with him, Mother...

109
00:07:51,607 --> 00:07:53,916
- and he with me.
- He's using you.

110
00:07:55,087 --> 00:07:57,078
I don't wish to discuss it further!

111
00:07:59,407 --> 00:08:03,446
You're living in a fool's paradise
if you think Tiberius will agree.

112
00:08:05,687 --> 00:08:09,236
If you marry him,
what will happen to his children?

113
00:08:09,407 --> 00:08:11,443
What do I care about his children?

114
00:08:11,607 --> 00:08:14,360
Apicata would like them
to live with her.

115
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:18,122
I see.
You've been talking to Apicata.

116
00:08:18,887 --> 00:08:23,483
Yes. She wants you to persuade Sejanus
to let her have them back.

117
00:08:23,647 --> 00:08:25,717
He won't do that. He's fond of them.

118
00:08:25,887 --> 00:08:29,357
Let her see them again.
He's stopped her seeing them.

119
00:08:29,527 --> 00:08:31,438
What's that to me?!

120
00:08:32,287 --> 00:08:34,039
I don't know.

121
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:37,887
Perhaps one day,
it might be a great deal

122
00:08:43,567 --> 00:08:46,240
I cannot allow you to marry Livilla.

123
00:08:46,407 --> 00:08:50,082
I've read your letter carefully
and given it a lot of thought,

124
00:08:50,247 --> 00:08:52,715
but I'm afraid the answer
must be no.

125
00:08:52,887 --> 00:08:54,559
May I know the reasons?

126
00:08:54,727 --> 00:08:56,638
You're entitled to know them.

127
00:08:57,447 --> 00:09:01,076
Such a marriage would compel me
to raise you to an exalted rank.

128
00:09:01,247 --> 00:09:05,001
- I've never looked for that.
- I know, but I'd have no choice.

129
00:09:05,167 --> 00:09:08,762
Do you suppose that Livilla
would be content to grow old

130
00:09:08,927 --> 00:09:11,236
as the wife of a man
outside the Senate?

131
00:09:12,127 --> 00:09:14,687
Well. you could ask her.

132
00:09:14,847 --> 00:09:18,965
Her answer would be one thing
before marriage and another after.

133
00:09:19,127 --> 00:09:22,836
Her brother, Germanicus,
and her father Drusus, my brother,

134
00:09:23,007 --> 00:09:25,999
both held the highest offices
of state.

135
00:09:26,167 --> 00:09:29,842
Don't you think a faction in Rome
would demand the same for you?

136
00:09:30,007 --> 00:09:33,716
I have always said I have no wish
to rise above my present rank.

137
00:09:33,887 --> 00:09:37,800
Some would say you have risen
above them even without rank.

138
00:09:38,567 --> 00:09:42,446
You see, in envying you,
they criticise me.

139
00:09:47,727 --> 00:09:50,480
You say, on the one hand
I have too many friends,

140
00:09:50,647 --> 00:09:52,922
and on the other,
I have too many enemies.

141
00:09:53,087 --> 00:09:56,204
- Is it untrue?
- I've made them in your service.

142
00:09:56,367 --> 00:09:59,200
- Oh, I know that.
- I'm not complaining.

143
00:09:59,367 --> 00:10:01,517
I know, but you're disappointed.

144
00:10:01,687 --> 00:10:03,996
Let me put another proposal to you.

145
00:10:05,207 --> 00:10:07,437
One that would excite less comment.

146
00:10:08,327 --> 00:10:10,204
Since Nero's arrest,

147
00:10:10,367 --> 00:10:14,645
his betrothal to Livilla's daughter
must be considered at an end.

148
00:10:14,807 --> 00:10:17,685
Would you contemplate marriage
with her?.

149
00:10:20,527 --> 00:10:22,677
- With Helen?
- Why not?.

150
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:25,919
Such an alliance would be
much more acceptable to me.

151
00:10:27,087 --> 00:10:30,921
Well. think about it.
Now, who wishes to see me?

152
00:10:32,487 --> 00:10:35,684
Um... I have the list here.

153
00:10:36,487 --> 00:10:40,560
I've marked the ones you should see.
The rest are of no consequence.

154
00:10:40,727 --> 00:10:43,878
Those you've marked
I'll see tomorrow.

155
00:10:44,047 --> 00:10:46,038
The rest you can send away.

156
00:10:46,207 --> 00:10:48,198
You can deal with them yourself.

157
00:10:48,367 --> 00:10:51,677
- And Agrippina?
- I'll see her now.

158
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:57,760
I take it you have no wish
to see Nero?

159
00:10:57,927 --> 00:10:59,246
None.

160
00:11:02,127 --> 00:11:06,723
Well. Thrasyllus, was I wise
to deny him marriage with Livilla?

161
00:11:09,847 --> 00:11:11,326
Thrasyllus?

162
00:11:11,847 --> 00:11:13,963
Wise, Excellency.

163
00:11:14,367 --> 00:11:16,835
And to offer him her daughter instead?

164
00:11:17,007 --> 00:11:20,158
- He deserves it.
- He's my right hand.

165
00:11:21,127 --> 00:11:25,279
Without him I'd be a drudge in Rome
and the butt of everybody’s hate.

166
00:11:26,047 --> 00:11:29,642
As it is, let him be the drudge
and him be the butt.

167
00:11:31,287 --> 00:11:35,599
My dear...you look like
a Greek tragedy.

168
00:11:36,327 --> 00:11:38,443
And you look like a Roman farce.

169
00:11:41,687 --> 00:11:45,282
Your tongue has cost you dear
and will cost you dearer.

170
00:11:45,447 --> 00:11:47,438
You pitiful worm-eaten old ruin!

171
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:49,325
It's not my tongue that costs me,

172
00:11:49,487 --> 00:11:52,445
but the love people have
for me and my family.

173
00:11:54,367 --> 00:11:57,086
And how you have used that love
against me.

174
00:11:57,247 --> 00:11:59,317
Against you?

175
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:04,917
Germanicus could have led
the armies of the Rhine against you.

176
00:12:05,087 --> 00:12:09,922
They proclaimed him Emperor, but he said
Rome already had one. The fool!

177
00:12:10,087 --> 00:12:12,999
Every word you say
makes my task easier.

178
00:12:13,167 --> 00:12:17,683
Don't pretend you ever found it hard
to be vindictive. You always were.

179
00:12:17,847 --> 00:12:21,237
Are you so senile that you're blind
to your own interests?

180
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,159
I'm not blind to yours.

181
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:26,080
You're an old man
and you'll die soon.

182
00:12:26,247 --> 00:12:29,557
Who can succeed but one
of the sons of Germanicus?

183
00:12:29,727 --> 00:12:32,560
I've a grandson of my own -
Livilla's boy.

184
00:12:33,807 --> 00:12:35,798
Gemellus is a child.

185
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:39,403
Rome isn't Egypt. Children don't rule
because their father ruled.

186
00:12:39,567 --> 00:12:41,717
Rome must be governed by men.

187
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:43,957
I'll make my own arrangements!

188
00:12:46,287 --> 00:12:47,606
You?

189
00:12:49,767 --> 00:12:53,919
You think you'll make them,
but he'll make them.

190
00:12:55,287 --> 00:12:58,916
Sejanus - that black spider
that sits on your shoulder

191
00:12:59,087 --> 00:13:01,157
squirting his poison in your ear.

192
00:13:01,807 --> 00:13:03,798
You think you rule in Rome?

193
00:13:04,287 --> 00:13:06,437
He rules in Rome!

194
00:13:09,447 --> 00:13:12,041
And the moment
the last of my boys is dead,

195
00:13:12,207 --> 00:13:14,038
you'll know he rules in Rome.

196
00:13:14,207 --> 00:13:18,086
My dear, how pretty you look
when you look angry.

197
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:21,441
It makes me surd
to have to send you away.

198
00:13:23,767 --> 00:13:27,442
But a queen must have a domain
and I've chosen yours.

199
00:13:28,167 --> 00:13:30,681
Do you know where
I'm going to send you?

200
00:13:30,847 --> 00:13:32,838
To the island of Panadoria,

201
00:13:33,007 --> 00:13:38,718
where Julia, your mother,
spent so many years in exile.

202
00:13:41,367 --> 00:13:43,403
You will inherit her kingdom.

203
00:13:44,447 --> 00:13:49,521
That's only just.
Your greatest wish will be fulfilled.

204
00:13:49,687 --> 00:13:51,917
You will be queen after all

205
00:13:52,087 --> 00:13:54,806
As for Nero,
I'm sending him to Ponza.

206
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:57,686
An island even smaller than yours.

207
00:13:58,607 --> 00:14:03,476
You'll have to think how to govern
these mighty empires.

208
00:14:06,567 --> 00:14:11,277
If you're lonely,
I could come and call on you.

209
00:14:19,847 --> 00:14:24,204
Blood-soaked mud you've been called
and that's what you are.

210
00:14:29,207 --> 00:14:31,767
(YELLS) Bring me a vine branch!

211
00:14:33,887 --> 00:14:38,244
This queen needs flogging
before she goes!

212
00:14:53,407 --> 00:14:56,638
Gentlemen, if you leave your names
with my secretary,

213
00:14:56,807 --> 00:14:59,799
all your requests
will be considered. Excuse me.

214
00:15:02,047 --> 00:15:06,802
Commander, did you mention
my case to the Emperor?.

215
00:15:06,967 --> 00:15:11,006
It was discussed. His decision
will be communicated to you.

216
00:15:11,167 --> 00:15:13,727
- But you did promise...
- Excuse me.

217
00:15:20,007 --> 00:15:23,443
Father, Father, you're back!

218
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:28,715
- I told you he'd be back today.
- You only guessed.

219
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:30,639
Well. I was right.

220
00:15:30,807 --> 00:15:34,641
May we have dinner with you?
We've been very good, haven't we?

221
00:15:34,807 --> 00:15:36,798
We've done all our lessons.

222
00:15:36,967 --> 00:15:39,276
Then you can have dinner with me.

223
00:15:40,167 --> 00:15:42,635
Now go to your rooms.
I have work to do.

224
00:15:44,247 --> 00:15:47,045
Father, why can't
we see Mother again?

225
00:15:49,727 --> 00:15:52,605
I told you I didn't wish
to discuss that again.

226
00:15:52,767 --> 00:15:54,723
I'm displeased that you disobey me.

227
00:15:55,327 --> 00:15:59,479
She came here while you were away.
The servants wouldn't let her in.

228
00:15:59,647 --> 00:16:02,207
Father, please let her
come and see us?

229
00:16:02,367 --> 00:16:05,643
Go to your rooms.
You have made me very angry.

230
00:16:06,527 --> 00:16:08,404
Don't be angry.

231
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:11,684
We didn't mean
to make you angry, did we, Junius?

232
00:16:12,367 --> 00:16:14,403
Only we do miss her.

233
00:16:14,567 --> 00:16:16,558
The Lady Livilla is here.

234
00:16:18,847 --> 00:16:20,838
What a pretty girl you are, Arria.

235
00:16:21,007 --> 00:16:22,520
Thank you.

236
00:16:24,727 --> 00:16:28,481
Go to your rooms.
We'll meat again at dinner.

237
00:16:31,927 --> 00:16:34,521
- Did you ask him?
- Yes.

238
00:16:34,687 --> 00:16:36,598
What did he say?.

239
00:16:36,767 --> 00:16:39,327
He refused.

240
00:16:40,687 --> 00:16:42,803
Refused? But why?.

241
00:16:42,967 --> 00:16:47,199
He said you were too exalted for me.
Well. in a way, you are.

242
00:16:48,287 --> 00:16:50,118
But we must marry.

243
00:16:50,287 --> 00:16:54,997
That's what we've planned,
what we've waited for.

244
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,718
Did he give any other reason?

245
00:16:57,887 --> 00:17:01,926
He said you wouldn't be content
that I remain in my present rank.

246
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:04,999
He said it would foster
dangerous jealousies.

247
00:17:06,807 --> 00:17:08,798
Then you must try again later.

248
00:17:09,727 --> 00:17:11,365
I don't think so.

249
00:17:11,527 --> 00:17:15,839
I think we may have made a mistake
in asking him.

250
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:21,560
- It may have made him suspicious.
- I have the right to marry again.

251
00:17:24,927 --> 00:17:29,637
If he won't give his permission,
we shall marry without it.

252
00:17:29,807 --> 00:17:32,799
- That might be dangerous.
- What are we to do?

253
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:35,724
I want to be married.

254
00:17:36,927 --> 00:17:40,966
You promised me marriage!
Have you changed your mind?

255
00:17:41,127 --> 00:17:44,005
- No, of course not.
- Does it suit you as we are?

256
00:17:45,127 --> 00:17:49,120
My darling, all that I have done
I have done for one reason -

257
00:17:49,287 --> 00:17:52,324
that is to give us the right
to be together.

258
00:17:52,487 --> 00:17:55,957
And that old goat
is not going to stop us.

259
00:17:56,127 --> 00:17:58,800
- He did suggest something.
- Something?

260
00:17:58,967 --> 00:18:00,798
He said...

261
00:18:01,767 --> 00:18:06,761
He wasn't opposed in principle
to a marriage link with his family.

262
00:18:07,407 --> 00:18:10,126
He suggested a marriage
with your daughter.

263
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:15,798
You bastard.

264
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:19,803
You bastard.

265
00:18:21,727 --> 00:18:24,878
- I'll kill you! I'll kill you!
- Stop it!

266
00:18:25,047 --> 00:18:27,242
- You filthy swine!
- Listen to me!

267
00:18:27,407 --> 00:18:31,400
If that is one way
we can be together, then why not?.

268
00:18:31,567 --> 00:18:34,957
You'd like that! To be in bed
with mother and daughter!

269
00:18:35,127 --> 00:18:37,880
You bastard! You filthy bastard!

270
00:18:41,847 --> 00:18:43,280
(SEJANUS) Listen.

271
00:18:44,807 --> 00:18:47,162
- Let's be practical
- Don't touch me!

272
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:49,204
Helen means nothing to me!

273
00:18:49,367 --> 00:18:52,325
But if Tiberius agrees,
it solves our problem.

274
00:18:52,487 --> 00:18:55,160
I will be linked
with the Imperial family.

275
00:18:55,327 --> 00:18:57,522
You'll live with us.
We'll be together.

276
00:18:57,687 --> 00:19:00,440
- Will Helen agree?
- Helen will do as she's told.

277
00:19:00,607 --> 00:19:02,438
- It will mean a break...
- A break?

278
00:19:02,607 --> 00:19:07,362
Until the marriage. Then it'll be
as though it never happened.

279
00:19:07,527 --> 00:19:10,678
You'll service us both then?
Like a stallion?

280
00:19:10,847 --> 00:19:14,362
Don't talk like that! I love you!

281
00:19:15,527 --> 00:19:18,678
Don't spoil it.
Everything is going as we planned.

282
00:19:20,247 --> 00:19:24,399
Agrippina and Nero have been banished.
They won't return.

283
00:19:24,567 --> 00:19:27,957
I'm having documents prepared
to send Drusus the same way.

284
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:32,405
Tiberius will consent to his arrest.
That leaves Caligula to deal with.

285
00:19:32,567 --> 00:19:36,799
Then Tiberius will have no one
to turn to but me.

286
00:19:37,407 --> 00:19:40,956
Now, let's be sensible.
We have waited a long time.

287
00:19:46,247 --> 00:19:48,556
You know I am nothing without you.

288
00:19:51,047 --> 00:19:55,643
Let me talk to Helen.
Let me persuade her.

289
00:19:57,887 --> 00:20:00,959
Trust me. That's all I ask.

290
00:20:04,607 --> 00:20:09,681
Once again, the Emperor writes
from Capri demanding another arrest!

291
00:20:09,847 --> 00:20:13,840
First it was the Lady Agrippina
and her eldest son, Nero Caesar,

292
00:20:14,007 --> 00:20:17,204
and now it is her second son,
Drusus Caesar.

293
00:20:18,247 --> 00:20:21,842
No documents are produced
for the Senate to investigate.

294
00:20:22,007 --> 00:20:24,919
Only our "consent" is asked for.

295
00:20:25,687 --> 00:20:27,803
Our signature.

296
00:20:27,967 --> 00:20:30,925
Like that of some compliant wife.

297
00:20:31,927 --> 00:20:36,603
Senators, my signature
is not to be had for the asking.

298
00:20:38,687 --> 00:20:42,760
I was brought up to read a document
before I signed it.

299
00:20:42,927 --> 00:20:45,282
You may do as you please.

300
00:20:53,207 --> 00:20:57,439
Senators, I ask that the question
be put for the arrest of Drusus Caesar.

301
00:20:58,167 --> 00:21:00,362
- No!
- Aye!

302
00:21:00,527 --> 00:21:02,757
(ALL) Aye!

303
00:21:02,927 --> 00:21:04,645
Aye!

304
00:21:04,807 --> 00:21:07,879
I must see the Emperor!
Those letters were forged!

305
00:21:08,047 --> 00:21:09,878
- Get in!
- They’re not mine!

306
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:14,724
Please! Let me see Sejanus, then!

307
00:21:16,967 --> 00:21:20,516
Please let me out!
Please let me out!

308
00:21:20,687 --> 00:21:24,236
If he keeps it up, quieten him.
Otherwise, don't open the door.

309
00:21:24,407 --> 00:21:27,001
- How do we feed him?
- You don't.

310
00:21:35,367 --> 00:21:37,756
Uncle Claudius!

311
00:21:42,447 --> 00:21:44,165
Uncle Claudius!

312
00:21:44,847 --> 00:21:47,077
C-Caligula. Where have you been?

313
00:21:47,847 --> 00:21:51,886
Staying at the house in Antium.
I took some friends down there.

314
00:21:52,047 --> 00:21:53,685
We had a wonderful time.

315
00:21:53,847 --> 00:21:56,566
Have you heard D-Drusus
has been arrested?

316
00:21:57,327 --> 00:21:59,841
Yes, it's a great shame, isn't it?.

317
00:22:02,727 --> 00:22:04,718
Do you think they’ll kill him?

318
00:22:04,887 --> 00:22:08,084
Well. d-doesn't it worry you?
He's your brother.

319
00:22:08,247 --> 00:22:10,283
I said it was a shame, didn't I?

320
00:22:10,447 --> 00:22:12,642
Listen. Caligula.

321
00:22:13,327 --> 00:22:15,477
I think you're in grave danger.

322
00:22:15,647 --> 00:22:16,966
Who from?

323
00:22:20,487 --> 00:22:22,205
- Who?
- Sshh!

324
00:22:27,607 --> 00:22:29,165
Tiberius.

325
00:22:29,327 --> 00:22:31,363
- Tiberius?
- Sshh!

326
00:22:32,287 --> 00:22:35,996
No, I don't think so.
He's invited me to Capri.

327
00:22:36,767 --> 00:22:39,122
T-to C-Capri?

328
00:22:39,847 --> 00:22:42,645
Yes, to C-C-Capri. Yes.

329
00:22:43,327 --> 00:22:46,160
- Are you going?
- Of course I am.

330
00:22:46,327 --> 00:22:50,843
Everyone has such a marvellous time.
Do you believe the stories?

331
00:22:51,007 --> 00:22:52,804
They say he has little girls

332
00:22:52,967 --> 00:22:57,199
running around the gardens
like wood nymphs, naked.

333
00:22:57,767 --> 00:23:01,476
- What are you going to say to him?
- What about?.

334
00:23:01,647 --> 00:23:04,719
About your mother
and your t-t-two brothers.

335
00:23:04,887 --> 00:23:08,197
- What can I say to him?
- Damn it, doesn't it bother you?!

336
00:23:08,367 --> 00:23:10,403
Yes, of course it does!

337
00:23:14,927 --> 00:23:19,159
I shall have to watch my step.
Very unpredictable these days.

338
00:23:19,767 --> 00:23:21,200
Listen, Cal..

339
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:26,126
Caligula, if you get the chance,
you must s-speak up for them.

340
00:23:27,167 --> 00:23:30,523
Of course I shall
For Mother, anyway.

341
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:35,160
I couldn't give a damn
about Drusus and Nero.

342
00:23:35,327 --> 00:23:37,761
- But they’re your brothers.
- Yes, I know.

343
00:23:37,927 --> 00:23:41,237
But you don't like Aunt Livilla
and she's your sister.

344
00:23:42,127 --> 00:23:44,516
Now, I love my sisters, Uncle.

345
00:23:44,687 --> 00:23:46,359
Yes, I know.

346
00:23:49,687 --> 00:23:54,966
You know, you depress me
unutterably s-sometimes. Goodbye.

347
00:24:00,567 --> 00:24:01,886
On!

348
00:24:02,047 --> 00:24:04,197
Your wife, the Lady Aelia, is here.

349
00:24:04,367 --> 00:24:08,326
My w=w=wife? What does she w=want?.

350
00:24:08,487 --> 00:24:12,639
- How do I know?. She's not my wife.
- Don't be so damned r-rude!

351
00:24:12,807 --> 00:24:14,638
Anyway, show her in.

352
00:24:27,567 --> 00:24:29,239
Claudius.

353
00:24:29,407 --> 00:24:33,764
I heard you were in Rome.
Why didn't you come and see me?

354
00:24:33,927 --> 00:24:35,360
W-what for?.

355
00:24:35,527 --> 00:24:39,964
What for?. Shouldn't a husband
be seen with his wife?

356
00:24:40,127 --> 00:24:43,039
Well. we're not exactly
a husband and w=wife.

357
00:24:43,207 --> 00:24:45,641
But I'll come and see you
if you like.

358
00:24:45,807 --> 00:24:49,641
Don't flatter yourself.
It's to your advantage to be seen with me.

359
00:24:49,807 --> 00:24:53,561
You're not every woman's
ideal husband.

360
00:24:53,727 --> 00:24:56,639
In fact you're not
any woman's ideal husband.

361
00:24:56,807 --> 00:24:59,640
Did you come here
j-just to tell me this?

362
00:24:59,807 --> 00:25:01,877
Oh, don't try and be clever with me.

363
00:25:02,807 --> 00:25:05,241
I came here to see your sister,

364
00:25:05,407 --> 00:25:09,400
and as you were here, I thought
I'd let you know I was alive and well

365
00:25:09,567 --> 00:25:11,603
Are you alive and well?.

366
00:25:11,767 --> 00:25:15,806
- I t-think so.
- You don't look either to me.

367
00:25:16,447 --> 00:25:19,598
Well. it's been a very trying time
since I got here.

368
00:25:19,767 --> 00:25:22,565
You know my sister-in-law's
been arrested?

369
00:25:22,727 --> 00:25:25,958
Agrippina, yes.
That's been coming for some time.

370
00:25:26,767 --> 00:25:29,076
Thank your stars
you're married to me.

371
00:25:29,247 --> 00:25:32,444
That's brought you
under my brother's protection.

372
00:25:32,607 --> 00:25:35,326
So what are you doing in Rome?

373
00:25:35,487 --> 00:25:38,285
Oh, I came up
to use the P-Pollio Library.

374
00:25:38,447 --> 00:25:42,235
I've just finished a history of Carthage.
Would you like a copy?.

375
00:25:42,407 --> 00:25:44,523
- Are you being funny?.
- Ahem!

376
00:25:44,687 --> 00:25:48,396
Oh, Mother.
Aelia has just called to see us.

377
00:25:48,567 --> 00:25:51,001
Well. I really came to see Livilla.

378
00:25:51,167 --> 00:25:54,239
I should have been surprised
if you'd came to see my son.

379
00:25:54,407 --> 00:25:56,762
He makes no effort to see me either.

380
00:25:56,927 --> 00:26:00,602
It's an arrangement
that suits us both.

381
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:04,601
I'm sure it does.
I find life very strange today.

382
00:26:04,767 --> 00:26:08,760
Those who are married live apart
and those who aren't live together.

383
00:26:08,927 --> 00:26:11,202
We should abolish marriage
altogether.

384
00:26:12,127 --> 00:26:14,595
Well. your ideas
are too advanced for me.

385
00:26:15,287 --> 00:26:18,040
Well. Livilla is waiting.

386
00:26:21,127 --> 00:26:22,640
Excuse me.

387
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:27,840
What does she want with Livilla?

388
00:26:28,007 --> 00:26:29,520
I don't know.

389
00:26:31,607 --> 00:26:35,486
Perhaps Sejanus sent her
to find out how Helen was.

390
00:26:36,287 --> 00:26:40,166
Am I to understand that man is now
paying court to my granddaughter?.

391
00:26:40,327 --> 00:26:43,524
He's had meetings with her.
He's not seeing Livilla.

392
00:26:43,687 --> 00:26:46,679
What is wrong with Helen?
The doctors don't know.

393
00:26:46,847 --> 00:26:50,476
Well. perhaps it's just
one of those women's complaints.

394
00:26:51,687 --> 00:26:55,680
Don't be so ridiculous.
What do you know of women's complaints?

395
00:26:55,847 --> 00:26:57,838
The girl's been in bed for a weak!

396
00:27:01,487 --> 00:27:03,796
I want you to give him this.

397
00:27:04,327 --> 00:27:08,878
No one must see it, and tell him
to destroy it when he's read it.

398
00:27:10,207 --> 00:27:13,483
How is Helen? Is she improving?

399
00:27:14,807 --> 00:27:18,197
What is wrong with her?.
He's very anxious about her.

400
00:27:18,367 --> 00:27:20,676
He'd do better to be anxious
about me.

401
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:25,443
My dear, his feelings for you
are unchanged, you must know that.

402
00:27:25,607 --> 00:27:28,246
His marriage to Helen
is one of convenience.

403
00:27:28,407 --> 00:27:30,602
But he promised to marry me.

404
00:27:31,407 --> 00:27:34,524
Do you think I'm going to watch him
marry my daughter?.

405
00:27:34,687 --> 00:27:37,599
- But if Tiberius...
- Oh, Tiberius! Tiberius!

406
00:27:37,767 --> 00:27:39,837
Tiberius won't live for ever!

407
00:27:41,527 --> 00:27:44,758
Your brother belongs to me!
Tell him not to forget that!

408
00:27:44,927 --> 00:27:47,725
He hasn't forgotten it.
He loves you.

409
00:27:47,887 --> 00:27:50,447
He manages well enough
without seeing me.

410
00:27:51,847 --> 00:27:53,917
Men are different.

411
00:27:57,887 --> 00:28:00,606
It's driving me to despair!

412
00:28:03,967 --> 00:28:06,276
I can't bear this separation.

413
00:28:07,527 --> 00:28:09,836
But it's only for a little while.

414
00:28:10,887 --> 00:28:13,640
And for appearances' sake.

415
00:28:21,647 --> 00:28:24,525
Ah, Atticus, how's it coming?

416
00:28:24,687 --> 00:28:27,918
Ah, my dear sir, so well So well!

417
00:28:28,087 --> 00:28:30,521
We've already completed
twelve copies.

418
00:28:30,687 --> 00:28:34,965
It's going to be a wonderful edition.
Look at this lettering.

419
00:28:35,127 --> 00:28:37,960
- Have you ever seen the like?
- It's very good.

420
00:28:38,127 --> 00:28:41,005
I don't like this decoration.
It's too ornate.

421
00:28:41,167 --> 00:28:43,317
This decoration is fashionable.

422
00:28:43,487 --> 00:28:47,605
And for a history of Carthage,
what could be more apt than elephants?

423
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:49,758
I didn't ask for elephants.

424
00:28:49,927 --> 00:28:52,316
Yes, I know you didn't ask
for elephants,

425
00:28:52,487 --> 00:28:55,638
but knowing your good taste,
I thought you'd agree.

426
00:28:55,807 --> 00:28:58,321
Well. I don't!
This is a serious work.

427
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:02,036
Just because I mention elephants,
why do we have to see them?

428
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:05,643
- It's a motif.
- It's a d-damned s-silly motif!

429
00:29:06,407 --> 00:29:08,398
I mention Hannibal's mistresses.

430
00:29:08,567 --> 00:29:11,764
I suppose you've drawn
concubines all over it too!

431
00:29:11,927 --> 00:29:14,600
- If you don't like elephants...
- No, I don't.

432
00:29:14,767 --> 00:29:18,282
Very well No more elephants.
Elephants are out.

433
00:29:18,447 --> 00:29:22,884
Our esteemed client disapproves
of elephants, even your elephants,

434
00:29:23,047 --> 00:29:26,084
which, I may say,
are exquisitely drawn.

435
00:29:26,247 --> 00:29:28,715
But if a client
does not like elephants,

436
00:29:28,887 --> 00:29:31,003
we shall force no elephants
upon him.

437
00:29:31,167 --> 00:29:33,476
You will re-work the entire edition.

438
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:35,478
The copies won't be ready in time.

439
00:29:35,647 --> 00:29:40,198
Well. I need one copy today.
Very well I'll take one with elephants.

440
00:29:40,367 --> 00:29:43,996
- Are you quite sure?
- I'm quite sure! Just g-get it!

441
00:29:44,167 --> 00:29:48,877
Ah, my dear Asinius Gallus,
what a pleasure to see you.

442
00:29:49,047 --> 00:29:51,436
One History of Carthage
with elephants.

443
00:29:51,607 --> 00:29:54,758
Your work is on time.
Copies will be ready in seven days.

444
00:29:54,927 --> 00:29:58,442
Good. Claudius, what's this
about a History of Carthage?

445
00:29:58,607 --> 00:30:02,839
I'm having one copied. Without elephants.
I'll send you a copy.

446
00:30:03,007 --> 00:30:05,760
Did you read my essay
on Pollio and Cicero?

447
00:30:05,927 --> 00:30:08,760
Yes. I didn't quite agree with it.

448
00:30:08,927 --> 00:30:12,715
Ah. Well. walk with me to the Senate
and tell me why not.

449
00:30:12,887 --> 00:30:14,878
- Goodbye, Atticus.
- Goodbye.

450
00:30:16,287 --> 00:30:19,245
You will erase
all trace of elephants,

451
00:30:19,407 --> 00:30:21,921
leaving only the bar text.

452
00:30:23,967 --> 00:30:26,720
What a feast for his readers!

453
00:30:26,887 --> 00:30:30,038
Gallus, I heard P-Pollio
speak many times.

454
00:30:30,207 --> 00:30:33,119
He was a great orator,
but no comparison with Cicero.

455
00:30:33,287 --> 00:30:37,485
Cicero's speeches were pompous
and he thought far too much of himself.

456
00:30:37,647 --> 00:30:40,605
They must have sounded
worse than they read.

457
00:30:40,767 --> 00:30:42,485
Asinius Gallus?

458
00:30:51,167 --> 00:30:52,964
Lucius Asinius Gallus.

459
00:30:53,127 --> 00:30:56,199
I've a warrant signed by the Emperor
for your arrest.

460
00:30:57,167 --> 00:30:59,044
My arrest?. On what grounds?

461
00:30:59,207 --> 00:31:03,280
Inciting enmity between the Emperor
and the commander of his guard.

462
00:31:05,487 --> 00:31:07,762
- Is this a joke?
- No joke.

463
00:31:10,887 --> 00:31:13,276
Better hurry with your history,
Claudius.

464
00:31:13,447 --> 00:31:15,915
There'll soon be no one left
to read it.

465
00:31:21,487 --> 00:31:24,718
- Sign it.
- What is it?.

466
00:31:24,887 --> 00:31:27,765
- A confession.
- To what?.

467
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:31,681
Your conspiracy with Drusus
to subvert the armies of the Rhine.

468
00:31:31,847 --> 00:31:33,724
- Huh!
- Sign it.

469
00:31:35,047 --> 00:31:37,083
You wrote it, you sign it.

470
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:59,319
Sign it. You will
before we've finished with you.

471
00:31:59,487 --> 00:32:03,002
I'll sign nothing for you to produce
after I'm dead.

472
00:32:03,167 --> 00:32:05,806
Bring me to trial or murder me.

473
00:32:05,967 --> 00:32:08,606
I have no need of a trial
to prove your guilt.

474
00:32:08,767 --> 00:32:11,884
A song sung by every
small-town corrupt policeman,

475
00:32:12,047 --> 00:32:17,121
which is what you are
and what you should have stayed.

476
00:32:17,287 --> 00:32:20,040
I've watched your career
with fascination.

477
00:32:20,207 --> 00:32:21,959
It's been a revelation to me.

478
00:32:22,127 --> 00:32:25,324
I never fully realised before
how a small mind,

479
00:32:25,487 --> 00:32:28,320
allied to unlimited ambition,
and without scruple

480
00:32:28,487 --> 00:32:30,796
can destroy a country
full of clever men.

481
00:32:30,967 --> 00:32:33,720
I've seen how frail
a civilisation is

482
00:32:33,887 --> 00:32:37,880
before the onslaught of a gust
of really bad breath!

483
00:32:43,087 --> 00:32:44,520
Yes.

484
00:32:45,687 --> 00:32:49,157
But I suppose you're not really
the destroyer.

485
00:32:49,327 --> 00:32:51,522
We must look elsewhere for that.

486
00:32:51,687 --> 00:32:56,158
You're merely the putrefaction

487
00:32:56,327 --> 00:32:58,921
that spreads after death -

488
00:32:59,087 --> 00:33:01,885
the outward and visible sign
of its presence.

489
00:33:22,007 --> 00:33:26,080
You're a lesson in history to me,
Sejanus.

490
00:33:27,047 --> 00:33:29,925
Proving that above all..

491
00:33:30,647 --> 00:33:38,327
mankind...needs...its sense...of...smell

492
00:33:47,087 --> 00:33:50,124
Bring him round
and we'll start again.

493
00:33:59,007 --> 00:34:02,397
They’ve arrested Asinius Gallus
on the steps of the Senate.

494
00:34:02,567 --> 00:34:04,478
- Read this.
- I was there.

495
00:34:04,647 --> 00:34:07,207
- Read it!
- Why?. What is it?. What are they?.

496
00:34:08,567 --> 00:34:12,116
I don't understand.
It's Livilla's writing.

497
00:34:12,287 --> 00:34:13,686
Read them!

498
00:34:20,127 --> 00:34:21,446
What...?

499
00:34:22,527 --> 00:34:25,678
They poisoned Castor. Both of them.

500
00:34:25,847 --> 00:34:27,758
Apicata was right.

501
00:34:27,927 --> 00:34:30,805
With his help,
my daughter murdered her husband.

502
00:34:30,967 --> 00:34:33,083
She reminds him of it there!

503
00:34:33,247 --> 00:34:37,798
Now she urges him to waste
no more time but assassinate Tiberius.

504
00:34:37,967 --> 00:34:41,482
It'll be easy, she says,
every Guard owes allegiance to him.

505
00:34:41,647 --> 00:34:44,639
- B-but what are these?
- Isn't it obvious?

506
00:34:44,807 --> 00:34:46,684
Drafts of the letter she wrote him.

507
00:34:46,847 --> 00:34:52,558
I see how difficult it would be to write.
How she crawls and grovels to him!

508
00:34:52,727 --> 00:34:54,763
But how did y-you find them?

509
00:34:54,927 --> 00:34:59,205
A slave was clearing out her room -
taking it all to the furnace.

510
00:34:59,367 --> 00:35:02,677
Perfectly good paper, most of it,
hardly written on.

511
00:35:04,567 --> 00:35:08,879
Oh, I thank the gods
for my habits of thrift.

512
00:35:09,047 --> 00:35:11,436
Oh, he's wicked, but she's worse.

513
00:35:11,607 --> 00:35:15,646
She is monstrous, monstrous!
And I gave her birth.

514
00:35:19,607 --> 00:35:23,236
- She's poisoning Helen.
- Oh, Mother!

515
00:35:23,407 --> 00:35:28,083
She's poisoning her, I tell you.
Slowly, bit by bit, she is poisoning her.

516
00:35:28,247 --> 00:35:31,478
She's obsessed. She will stop
at nothing to get him.

517
00:35:31,647 --> 00:35:34,445
Oh, Mother. What shall we do?

518
00:35:34,607 --> 00:35:36,757
Tiberius must be told.

519
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:40,363
D-do you want people to know
that your own daughter...?

520
00:35:41,487 --> 00:35:45,719
And nobody sees Tiberius or writes
to him except through Sejanus.

521
00:35:45,887 --> 00:35:47,878
What's that thing you're writing?

522
00:35:48,047 --> 00:35:50,686
Thing?
You mean my History of Carthage?

523
00:35:50,847 --> 00:35:54,601
- Yes. Is it finished?
- Yes. I was having it copied.

524
00:35:54,767 --> 00:35:58,840
I just brought one copy home.
W-would you like to read it?.

525
00:35:59,007 --> 00:36:00,998
No. I'll tell you what you must do.

526
00:36:01,167 --> 00:36:05,604
You must go to Sejanus and ask
permission to visit Tiberius.

527
00:36:05,767 --> 00:36:11,478
Tell him you want to ask Tiberius'
consent to dedicate the work to him.

528
00:36:12,607 --> 00:36:16,805
Sejanus has nothing but contempt
for you. He'll suspect nothing.

529
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:18,320
Thank you.

530
00:36:18,487 --> 00:36:23,003
Those papers must be pasted
in a scroll with a letter of mine,

531
00:36:23,167 --> 00:36:27,206
and you will tell Tiberius
to open that one first.

532
00:36:27,367 --> 00:36:31,360
I suppose I could,
but I didn't want to give him this copy.

533
00:36:31,527 --> 00:36:33,995
It's got elephants drawn all over it.

534
00:36:37,727 --> 00:36:40,400
You are the biggest fool
any mother ever had.

535
00:36:40,567 --> 00:36:44,606
Nobody will read your stupid history,
and certainly not Tiberius!

536
00:36:44,767 --> 00:36:47,884
The only way you'd get him to read it
is if you drew naked women on it!

537
00:36:59,647 --> 00:37:03,037
What?. Uncle Claudius!

538
00:37:03,807 --> 00:37:05,559
- Why...?
- Sshh!

539
00:37:09,447 --> 00:37:10,960
Get out!

540
00:37:22,527 --> 00:37:24,597
You know what's in this scroll?.

541
00:37:24,767 --> 00:37:26,917
Your mother's a very noble woman.

542
00:37:27,087 --> 00:37:28,759
What's happened?

543
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:31,763
Your uncle has brought me evidence

544
00:37:31,927 --> 00:37:34,395
that my son was poisoned
by his wife.

545
00:37:35,047 --> 00:37:36,924
Aunt Livilla?

546
00:37:38,327 --> 00:37:40,887
I always knew that woman
was no good.

547
00:37:41,047 --> 00:37:44,164
She poisoned him
with the help of Sejanus.

548
00:37:45,647 --> 00:37:47,956
And now they plot to assassinate me.

549
00:37:48,927 --> 00:37:52,078
People really are despicable.

550
00:37:53,287 --> 00:37:57,326
The point is HOW to arrest him.

551
00:37:59,287 --> 00:38:01,198
He controls the Guard.

552
00:38:02,927 --> 00:38:05,805
Four thousand of them.

553
00:38:07,647 --> 00:38:09,638
All loyal to him...

554
00:38:10,727 --> 00:38:12,206
not to me.

555
00:38:12,367 --> 00:38:14,517
His loyal servants, not mine.

556
00:38:17,927 --> 00:38:19,918
Castor warned me.

557
00:38:21,527 --> 00:38:23,518
I wouldn't listen to him.

558
00:38:24,607 --> 00:38:29,158
Well. is there n-n-no one
among them you can trust?.

559
00:38:29,327 --> 00:38:32,319
No m-man of integrity?.

560
00:38:34,047 --> 00:38:35,958
Not that I know of.

561
00:38:36,127 --> 00:38:39,756
Isn't that a terrible comment
on our times, Uncle?

562
00:38:41,727 --> 00:38:46,642
On the other hand, if you can't
find a man of integrity,

563
00:38:46,807 --> 00:38:49,685
I always say
look for a man of ambition.

564
00:38:49,847 --> 00:38:52,236
Find a dog who'll eat a dog.

565
00:38:53,047 --> 00:38:55,083
Do you know of such a person?

566
00:38:55,247 --> 00:38:56,965
Yes, I do.

567
00:38:57,127 --> 00:39:00,278
Sertorius Macro,
Sejanus' second-in-command.

568
00:39:00,447 --> 00:39:04,520
- He's very popular with the troops.
- He arrested G-Gallus.

569
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:06,958
Isn't he loyal to Sejanus?

570
00:39:07,127 --> 00:39:11,518
Yes, of course, but he can't move up
while Sejanus is there, can he?

571
00:39:12,447 --> 00:39:14,802
And he is very ambitious.

572
00:39:14,967 --> 00:39:17,527
Do you know him personally?.

573
00:39:17,687 --> 00:39:20,360
No, but I've slept with his wife
several times.

574
00:39:22,207 --> 00:39:26,439
Is deception with the wife regarded
as an introduction to the husband?!

575
00:39:26,607 --> 00:39:28,643
Oh, he knows about that.

576
00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:32,365
I told you. He's ambitious.

577
00:39:36,807 --> 00:39:41,483
I shall make you my successor,
Gaius Caligula!

578
00:39:43,207 --> 00:39:44,640
I've decided.

579
00:39:44,807 --> 00:39:46,843
You shall stay here with me.

580
00:39:47,567 --> 00:39:49,842
Rome deserves you.

581
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:53,597
I will nurse you
like a viper in her bosom.

582
00:39:53,767 --> 00:39:57,476
- Is that a joke, Uncle?
- Not yet, but it will be.

583
00:39:59,247 --> 00:40:03,718
Sejanus must be put off his guard.
He must suspect nothing.

584
00:40:05,767 --> 00:40:08,998
I know. I'll tell him
I'm going to Rome,

585
00:40:09,167 --> 00:40:12,000
and ask him to meat me
on the Senate steps

586
00:40:12,167 --> 00:40:14,556
where he will hear
something surprising.

587
00:40:14,727 --> 00:40:19,039
What about his friends?
He has a lot of friends.

588
00:40:20,727 --> 00:40:24,766
You and I will draw up a list
during dinner.

589
00:40:26,607 --> 00:40:28,598
A long list.

590
00:40:30,047 --> 00:40:32,197
The city will be purged...

591
00:40:33,167 --> 00:40:37,763
as surely as if she had gorged
herself on figs for a year.

592
00:40:37,927 --> 00:40:41,158
I will open Rome's bowels!

593
00:40:41,327 --> 00:40:44,046
The streets will run like a sewer!

594
00:40:49,967 --> 00:40:52,720
- Hail. Sejanus.
- Macro, why are you here?

595
00:40:52,887 --> 00:40:55,959
The Emperor sent me
with a message for the Senate.

596
00:40:56,127 --> 00:41:00,200
- Where is the Emperor?.
- Waiting outside the city.

597
00:41:11,647 --> 00:41:13,683
Why did he not send for me?

598
00:41:14,527 --> 00:41:17,200
He could hardly ask you
to deliver this.

599
00:41:17,367 --> 00:41:21,121
I believe it requests that you be made
Protector of the City.

600
00:41:21,287 --> 00:41:24,085
Doesn't that mean his successor?.

601
00:41:29,047 --> 00:41:31,117
Then you had better deliver it.

602
00:41:38,807 --> 00:41:41,241
I'll see that you get my command.

603
00:41:46,887 --> 00:41:50,721
Why has Father gone inside?
Why doesn't he wait for the Emperor?.

604
00:41:50,887 --> 00:41:54,197
Because he's obviously not coming.
He never comes.

605
00:41:54,367 --> 00:41:57,757
What a shame.
We may as well go home, then.

606
00:42:00,007 --> 00:42:01,804
Captain of the Guard!

607
00:42:05,447 --> 00:42:08,007
- You recognise this seal?.
- The Emperor's.

608
00:42:08,167 --> 00:42:09,680
Read it.

609
00:42:12,407 --> 00:42:13,726
Sir!

610
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:18,563
Return to the barrack. All company
commanders are to remain in camp.

611
00:42:18,727 --> 00:42:20,126
Sir!

612
00:42:25,207 --> 00:42:26,765
Guard!

613
00:42:32,807 --> 00:42:34,399
Forward!

614

What's happening?

632
00:44:12,487 --> 00:44:17,038
Sejanus has fallen.
He's to be arrested. Let me pass.

(GIRL SCREAMS) You're hurting me!

Father! Father!

646
00:45:32,807 --> 00:45:37,244
I can't do it. I can't just
kill them. They’re under age.

647
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:39,398
They’re on the list. Get on with it.

648
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:45,235
The girl is a virgin.
It's unprecedented to kill a virgin!

649
00:45:45,407 --> 00:45:47,762
It will bring bad luck to the city.

650
00:45:48,527 --> 00:45:53,157
Make sure she's not a virgin
before you kill her. Get on with it!

651
00:46:03,087 --> 00:46:05,885
Macro, what have they done
with the children?

652
00:46:06,447 --> 00:46:10,804
They’ve gone on ahead of you,
my friend. Like a good many others.

653
00:46:12,047 --> 00:46:14,038
Take him.

654
00:46:35,647 --> 00:46:37,126
Mother!

655
00:46:37,287 --> 00:46:40,359
Let me out! Let me out!

656
00:46:41,007 --> 00:46:43,123
Let me out!

657
00:46:44,407 --> 00:46:47,399
(BANGING AND SCREAMING CONTINUES)

658
00:46:47,567 --> 00:46:49,319
Let me out!

659
00:46:57,727 --> 00:47:02,847
What are you doing?
What are you going to d-do with her?.

660
00:47:05,527 --> 00:47:09,281
Let her out! How long
are you going to leave her in there?

661
00:47:09,447 --> 00:47:14,805
- Until she dies.
- Dies...? Dies?

662
00:47:15,367 --> 00:47:19,645
Are you mad? She's your daughter.
How can you leave her to die?

663
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:21,604
That's her punishment.

664
00:47:21,767 --> 00:47:24,235
How can bear to sit
and listen to her?.

665
00:47:24,407 --> 00:47:26,204
And that's mine.

666
00:47:26,367 --> 00:47:27,846
Leave me, Claudius.

667
00:47:28,007 --> 00:47:32,046
I shan't move from here
until they open that door and find her dead.

668
00:47:32,927 --> 00:47:34,326
Leave me.

669
00:47:35,247 --> 00:47:37,044
Oh, no...

670
00:47:37,207 --> 00:47:39,004
No...

671
00:47:39,167 --> 00:47:40,520
No!

(DISTANT CROWD SHOUTING)

673
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:50,959
Claudius!

Claudius!

675
00:47:53,767 --> 00:47:55,359
Claudius!

676
00:47:56,287 --> 00:47:57,720
Claudius!

677
00:47:57,887 --> 00:48:01,960
Claudius, help me.
They’re killing everyone! Everyone.

678
00:48:02,127 --> 00:48:04,687
Everyone who was a friend
or a relative.

679
00:48:04,847 --> 00:48:08,999
Claudius, don't let them take me!
Save me, Claudius! Save me!

680
00:48:09,167 --> 00:48:12,921
I'll do anything. Anything, Claudius.
Let me hide here.

681
00:48:13,087 --> 00:48:17,683
Let me hide. I'm your wife!
You must protect me!

682
00:48:18,727 --> 00:48:21,639
Executions are taking place
all over the city.

683
00:48:21,807 --> 00:48:25,925
The Senate steps are strewn with bodies.
They’ve killed his children!

684
00:48:26,087 --> 00:48:27,566
His children?

685
00:48:27,727 --> 00:48:30,366
They raped the girl
before they killed her.

686
00:48:30,527 --> 00:48:33,724
They dressed the boy
in his manly gown.

687
00:48:33,887 --> 00:48:38,517
Apicata killed herself when she saw
what they did to the bodies!

688
00:48:40,527 --> 00:48:43,360
Rome, you are finished!

689
00:48:44,167 --> 00:48:45,566
Finished!

690
00:48:45,727 --> 00:48:48,082
You are despicable!

691
00:48:48,247 --> 00:48:50,158
Despicable!

692
00:48:50,327 --> 00:48:52,716
Claudius, please, Claudius.
Save me...

693
00:48:52,887 --> 00:48:55,321
Oh, get out of my life!

694
00:48:55,487 --> 00:48:58,877
- No, Claudius!
- No, no!

695
00:48:59,047 --> 00:49:02,881
Go away! I never
want to see you again!

696
00:49:45,327 --> 00:49:48,478
My alliance by marriage
with Sejanus’ family

697
00:49:48,647 --> 00:49:53,675
might have cost me my life
had I not been my mother's son.

698
00:49:54,367 --> 00:49:56,642
I was now allowed to divorce Aelia

699
00:49:56,807 --> 00:50:00,163
and to return an eighth part
of her dowry.

700
00:50:01,007 --> 00:50:03,521
As a matter of fact, I returned it all

701
00:50:04,327 --> 00:50:06,966
She must have thought me a fool.
