1
00:00:54,927 --> 00:00:58,920
Beautiful. Lollia!
Where did you find her?.

2
00:00:59,087 --> 00:01:02,875
We saw her first in Antioch
when Titus was on duty there.

3
00:01:03,047 --> 00:01:05,038
We thought her so superb

4
00:01:05,207 --> 00:01:08,005
that Titus paid for her
to tour the provinces.

5
00:01:08,167 --> 00:01:11,318
And now, my dear friends,
the entertainment is over.

6
00:01:11,487 --> 00:01:14,877
It was w=wonderful
and a b-b-beautiful dinner.

7
00:01:15,047 --> 00:01:18,039
Thank you,
but I wasn't inviting a compliment.

8
00:01:18,207 --> 00:01:21,085
It's just that I have something
to perform.

9
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:25,206
And I've brought you here,
as our dearest friends, to be with me.

10
00:01:25,367 --> 00:01:27,358
What's this? A surprise for me too?

11
00:01:27,527 --> 00:01:31,202
- Yes, my dear, it is.
- She never tells me anything.

12
00:01:31,367 --> 00:01:35,076
Very naughty to surprise our guests
and not tell your husband.

13
00:01:36,447 --> 00:01:38,483
You know that I love you very much?

14
00:01:38,647 --> 00:01:42,037
Now I'm really worried.
This is going to cost a fortune!

15
00:01:42,207 --> 00:01:46,405
- How much have you spent?.
- Nothing. I've spent nothing.

16
00:01:47,247 --> 00:01:49,715
You may remember
that a weak ago tonight,

17
00:01:49,887 --> 00:01:52,685
we went to a dinner
given by the Emperor.

18
00:01:52,847 --> 00:01:54,166
Of course.

19
00:01:54,327 --> 00:02:00,323
You may also remember that Tiberius
was fascinated by our daughter.

20
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:04,162
I must admit, I saw him looking
at Camilla once or twice.

21
00:02:04,407 --> 00:02:06,398
What you don't know

22
00:02:06,567 --> 00:02:10,116
is that she received a summons
to the palace the next day.

23
00:02:10,287 --> 00:02:12,642
What?. A summons? You never told me.

24
00:02:12,807 --> 00:02:16,846
I thought it best not to put you
in a position where you would object.

25
00:02:17,007 --> 00:02:19,885
What is this, Lollia?
What are you telling me?

26
00:02:20,047 --> 00:02:23,562
A summons to the Emperor
is not something to be refused,

27
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:28,482
but I wouldn't let my daughter
go alone, knowing his reputation.

28
00:02:28,647 --> 00:02:30,638
So I went with her.

29
00:02:32,167 --> 00:02:36,399
We went into a room I imagine
he keeps for such receptions.

30
00:02:37,127 --> 00:02:41,996
I'd never been into that room before,
not met anyone who had.

31
00:02:43,327 --> 00:02:48,196
The walls were hung with what
the Emperor imagines is erotic art.

32
00:02:49,767 --> 00:02:53,646
They depict scenes
of incredible beastliness -

33
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:57,322
not fit for anyone to look at,
let alone a young girl

34
00:02:57,487 --> 00:03:01,480
Lollia, why are you telling me this now
in front of all our friends?

35
00:03:01,647 --> 00:03:03,638
These are not just friends.

36
00:03:03,807 --> 00:03:07,846
They are all. in their different ways,
important people in Rome.

37
00:03:08,007 --> 00:03:10,043
That's why they’re here tonight.

38
00:03:11,007 --> 00:03:14,283
He took Camilla up
to show her the paintings

39
00:03:14,447 --> 00:03:17,917
and talked about them
as if they were works of art.

40
00:03:19,127 --> 00:03:23,040
When I objected and said he should
be ashamed of himself

41
00:03:23,207 --> 00:03:25,402
for trying to corrupt a young girl,

42
00:03:25,567 --> 00:03:28,843
he simply smiled and said,
"What about an old one?"

43
00:03:29,007 --> 00:03:30,759
No, Titus, please.

44
00:03:32,047 --> 00:03:34,277
Then he clapped his hands,

45
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:38,963
and a slave appeared from another room
carrying a tray of wine.

46
00:03:41,407 --> 00:03:43,204
The slave was naked...

47
00:03:46,007 --> 00:03:52,480
and while Tiberius spoke to her,
he stroked the slave...

48
00:03:53,887 --> 00:03:59,484
In his twisted way, he thought
it might inflame Camilla's passions.

49
00:04:00,567 --> 00:04:04,401
But Camilla burst into tears
and begged to be allowed to leave.

50
00:04:05,327 --> 00:04:07,682
He then pretended to be upset

51
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:12,045
and complained she'd given him
a different impression at the dinner.

52
00:04:14,167 --> 00:04:17,364
He then turned to me
and told me to go home.

53
00:04:17,527 --> 00:04:19,119
- No more!
- No, Titus.

54
00:04:19,287 --> 00:04:21,596
- No, enough.
- Let me finish!

55
00:04:24,567 --> 00:04:28,116
If I'd had this with me then,
I'd have used it on him.

56
00:04:32,167 --> 00:04:34,806
Instead, I begged a moment
with him alone.

57
00:04:35,727 --> 00:04:37,479
He granted it.

58
00:04:40,767 --> 00:04:46,080
And there, I offered myself
in my daughter's place.

59
00:04:48,367 --> 00:04:50,358
Yes, Titus, my husband...

60
00:04:51,687 --> 00:04:54,918
to save my daughter,
I offered myself in her place.

61
00:04:55,927 --> 00:04:57,804
And he accepted.

62
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:02,363
My dear, that was nothing
for me to save her.

63
00:05:04,607 --> 00:05:06,598
I took her to the gate...

64
00:05:07,727 --> 00:05:10,878
and warned her not
to say anything to anyone...

65
00:05:12,407 --> 00:05:13,886
and then returned.

66
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:17,084
- Don't, Lollia, please...
- I've nearly finished.

67
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:22,406
I said that to prostitute myself
for my daughter was nothing.

68
00:05:22,567 --> 00:05:25,684
What wouldn't we do
to save our children?

69
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:30,403
I should have gone to the gate...

70
00:05:32,687 --> 00:05:35,076
into the room, out again...

71
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:40,078
No one would have been the wiser.

72
00:05:41,927 --> 00:05:43,918
I did go into that room.

73
00:05:45,287 --> 00:05:48,085
I was there subjected to...

74
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:53,604
acts of...

75
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:58,800
such abominable filth...

76
00:06:00,887 --> 00:06:04,675
to bestial obscenities...

77
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:09,798
with him and his solves
of both sexes...

78
00:06:10,927 --> 00:06:17,162
that mere prostitution seems
like a blessed state compared to it.

79
00:06:18,407 --> 00:06:22,320
You must forget, Lollia.
You must put it from your mind.

80
00:06:22,487 --> 00:06:25,559
You have saved your husband
and your daughter.

81
00:06:25,727 --> 00:06:28,161
No, Agrippina, that is not possible!

82
00:06:28,807 --> 00:06:32,117
If there'd been just one part of me
befouled by his lust,

83
00:06:32,287 --> 00:06:35,120
I should have come home
and cut it out!

84
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:38,005
With this knife!

85
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:43,718
But I can't live with the memory
of what he did to me.

86
00:06:44,767 --> 00:06:47,361
Nor can I get into
my husband's bed again.

87
00:06:48,927 --> 00:06:50,918
Nor have his arms around me.

88
00:06:51,087 --> 00:06:54,636
Nor feel the love he's had for me
all these years without...

89
00:06:56,407 --> 00:07:01,037
without the memory of that beast...

90
00:07:01,207 --> 00:07:04,597
and his beasts, coming between us.

91
00:07:08,367 --> 00:07:11,484
If I could...

92
00:07:12,167 --> 00:07:13,600
cut...

93
00:07:14,287 --> 00:07:16,084
from my mind!

94
00:07:24,607 --> 00:07:26,086
Lollia!

95
00:07:30,887 --> 00:07:32,286
Lollia.

96
00:07:39,407 --> 00:07:43,366
Make way, there!
Move aside for the Emperor!

97
00:07:43,527 --> 00:07:46,758
Don't block the road.
Make way, there.

98
00:07:46,927 --> 00:07:50,397
Stand aside. Clear the road
for the Emperor!

99
00:07:50,967 --> 00:07:52,525
Make way!

100
00:07:55,087 --> 00:07:56,884
Well. well!

101
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:02,198
Is it my son who greets his mother
with such affectionate eagerness?

102
00:08:02,367 --> 00:08:04,676
- Good day, Mother.
- In a hurry, are you?

103
00:08:04,847 --> 00:08:07,805
Another treason trial?.
Who is it today?.

104
00:08:07,967 --> 00:08:12,245
- There are no trials today.
- Ran out of people to prosecute?

105
00:08:12,407 --> 00:08:15,080
You'll have more time
to spend with your mother.

106
00:08:15,247 --> 00:08:19,206
- Don't shout. I'm not deaf.
- You've been deaf to me for years.

107
00:08:19,367 --> 00:08:24,316
Why did you refuse the Spanish
permission to build a temple to me?

108
00:08:24,487 --> 00:08:28,799
I will not discuss such matters
in the street. Good day. Move on.

109
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:33,119
It's my birthday next month!
What are you going to buy me?

110
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:36,156
I heard about Lollia! Disgusting!

111
00:08:36,327 --> 00:08:39,319
Your brother Drusus
was worth ten of you!

112
00:08:39,607 --> 00:08:42,644
Thrasyllus!
Where is that damned astrologer?.

113
00:08:44,567 --> 00:08:46,523
Coming, Excellency, coming.

114
00:08:46,687 --> 00:08:49,520
- Cast my mother's horoscope.
- What for?.

115
00:08:49,687 --> 00:08:53,202
I want to know how much longer
I have to put up with her.

116
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:55,835
- Do you know the time of her birth?
- No.

117
00:08:56,007 --> 00:08:57,918
I can only do a rough calculation.

118
00:08:58,087 --> 00:09:00,476
Why don't you ask her?.
It's her birthday soon.

119
00:09:00,647 --> 00:09:04,322
- It could be a present.
- Yes. She'd like that.

120
00:09:04,487 --> 00:09:08,400
She admires you since you prophesied
she'd outlive her husband.

121
00:09:08,567 --> 00:09:12,276
I could see she had every intention
of doing so.

122
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:14,836
Still. I'll ask her for an interview.

123
00:09:17,007 --> 00:09:19,646
What is she, a Loo? That's hopeful

124
00:09:19,807 --> 00:09:23,959
There's a bad time coming up
for Loo soon. I'll go and see her.

125
00:09:25,527 --> 00:09:29,805
I wish I'd stayed in Rhodes.
I wish I'd never returned.

126
00:09:31,167 --> 00:09:33,158
Someone must govern.

127
00:09:34,247 --> 00:09:36,442
Rome is fortunate that she has you.

128
00:09:37,767 --> 00:09:42,887
Yes. And I'm fortunate in you, Sejanus.
You're my ayes and ears.

129
00:09:43,047 --> 00:09:48,167
If it wasn't for you to relieve me
of some of my burden... What have we here?

130
00:09:48,367 --> 00:09:51,165
Conversations taken
down by my agents.

131
00:09:51,327 --> 00:09:54,080
Some are merely vicious.
Others treasonable.

132
00:09:54,247 --> 00:09:58,445
Doesn't anybody ever say anything
that isn't vicious or treasonable?!

133
00:09:58,607 --> 00:10:02,566
We've had more treason trials
in two years than the previous ten!

134
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:05,287
There is one I think
you should look at.

135
00:10:10,247 --> 00:10:13,000
- Silius Caecina?
-Hmm.

136
00:10:14,607 --> 00:10:17,201
Was he the corps commander
on the Upper Rhine?

137
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,323
That's the point.

138
00:10:23,287 --> 00:10:26,518
"Had it not been for the way
I handled my four regiments,

139
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,723
"they would have mutinied too."

140
00:10:28,887 --> 00:10:30,878
- He said that?.
- At a dinner party.

141
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,641
- What did he mean by it?.
- He went on to say

142
00:10:33,807 --> 00:10:38,642
that if his regiments had mutinied,
Tiberius would not be Emperor now.

143
00:10:39,527 --> 00:10:42,678
He implies
that you owe your position to him.

144
00:10:42,847 --> 00:10:47,477
Oh, well. he'd had too much wine.
You know what old soldiers are like.

145
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,842
They like to fight
their old battles.

146
00:10:50,007 --> 00:10:52,475
I think there may be more to it
than that.

147
00:10:53,047 --> 00:10:55,686
- Perhaps it's not important.
- What do you mean?

148
00:10:55,847 --> 00:10:58,486
Only that he went on to say,
lower down,

149
00:10:58,647 --> 00:11:02,276
that the regiments that did mutiny
had been under your command.

150
00:11:02,447 --> 00:11:05,325
He probably said it
because Agrippina was there.

151
00:11:05,487 --> 00:11:09,958
A compliment to her late husband
whose regiments remained loyal

152
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:13,437
Agrippina was at the dinner?.
Agrippina!

153
00:11:13,607 --> 00:11:16,246
The noble Gaius Caligula
to see the Emperor!

154
00:11:16,407 --> 00:11:18,477
What do you want?. I'm busy!

155
00:11:20,967 --> 00:11:22,958
I brought you a present.

156
00:11:23,127 --> 00:11:25,197
A present?. What sort of a present?.

157
00:11:25,367 --> 00:11:27,517
It took me a year to find it.

158
00:11:28,447 --> 00:11:33,726
When I heard about it, I said,
"That is for my great uncle, Tiberius."

159
00:11:35,727 --> 00:11:38,116
- Happy anniversary!
- What of?.

160
00:11:38,927 --> 00:11:42,158
What difference does it make?
Think of something.

161
00:11:47,727 --> 00:11:51,003
That's nothing.
Wait till you see the others.

162
00:11:53,047 --> 00:11:56,119
- Where did you get this?
- Elephantis.

163
00:11:56,287 --> 00:12:00,519
A merchant I know told me about it
and I asked him to get it for me.

164
00:12:01,647 --> 00:12:03,638
It cost quite a lot.

165
00:12:04,367 --> 00:12:08,724
It cost so much I had to borrow
part of it from Uncle Claudius!

166
00:12:10,007 --> 00:12:12,157
It's 200 years old.

167
00:12:15,127 --> 00:12:17,197
It was very thoughtful of you.

168
00:12:17,367 --> 00:12:19,358
I knew you'd like it.

169
00:12:20,567 --> 00:12:23,604
In fact I'd like to borrow it
myself some time.

170
00:12:23,767 --> 00:12:25,962
I mean, when you're not using it.

171
00:12:29,407 --> 00:12:31,363
I'd like you to examine the evidence

172
00:12:31,527 --> 00:12:34,917
to see if there's a case
for impeaching Silius Caecina.

173
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,078
- On a charge of treason?
- Yes.

174
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:40,205
For insulting references
towards the Emperor?.

175
00:12:42,327 --> 00:12:45,444
- Why not?.
- Well. I agree, why not.

176
00:12:45,607 --> 00:12:49,998
Blasphemies against Augustus have
been treasonable, but Tiberius?

177
00:12:50,167 --> 00:12:51,919
There's no precedent for it.

178
00:12:52,087 --> 00:12:55,477
The Emperor's noble son
Tiberius Drusus Caesar!

179
00:12:55,647 --> 00:12:58,286
Castor, how nice to see you.
Welcome back.

180
00:12:58,447 --> 00:13:00,802
I'm Castor to my friends, Sejanus.

181
00:13:00,967 --> 00:13:03,879
I had hoped you'd count me
among your friends.

182
00:13:04,047 --> 00:13:07,084
- Perhaps you will one day.
- That seems unlikely.

183
00:13:07,247 --> 00:13:09,681
Your father doesn't wish
to be disturbed.

184
00:13:11,607 --> 00:13:14,758
Announce me, you filthy German pig,

185
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:19,000
or I'll have you flogged and sent
back to the hut from which you came!

186
00:13:32,567 --> 00:13:37,004
Never mind precedent. I want
Silius Caecina impeached for treason.

187
00:13:37,167 --> 00:13:39,283
He has a great war record

188
00:13:39,447 --> 00:13:43,326
and he has powerful friends -
the Lady Agrippina for one.

189
00:13:43,487 --> 00:13:46,559
Shall I find someone else
or will you take the case?!

190
00:13:46,727 --> 00:13:49,560
Of course. I was
just clearing my mind.

191
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:54,880
- Germanicus was never your enemy!
- I tell you he was!

192
00:13:55,047 --> 00:13:59,245
I know what his ambitions were.
I have the proof here in the files.

193
00:13:59,407 --> 00:14:02,797
And I know how his widow
conspires against me now.

194
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:06,323
- Proof?. From Sejanus?
- Yes! From Sejanus.

195
00:14:06,487 --> 00:14:10,639
He at least keeps me informed
of what goes on in this city!

196
00:14:10,807 --> 00:14:14,482
Oh, Father, open your ayes!
The man is using you.

197
00:14:14,647 --> 00:14:17,002
You know nothing
he doesn't want you to know

198
00:14:17,167 --> 00:14:19,601
and see no one he doesn't
want you to see.

199
00:14:19,767 --> 00:14:21,758
He is the partner of my labours.

200
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:25,920
And soon he'll be your colleague,
but that won't be enough for him.

201
00:14:26,087 --> 00:14:30,365
That man has an apatite for power
unknown to you and me.

202
00:14:30,527 --> 00:14:32,358
Envy! Envy!

203
00:14:32,527 --> 00:14:35,485
You envy him because for years
he worked

204
00:14:35,647 --> 00:14:38,480
while you and that Judean friend
of yours, Herod,

205
00:14:38,647 --> 00:14:40,877
went whoring around the city!

206
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:43,322
He worked
to relieve me of my labours!

207
00:14:43,487 --> 00:14:47,560
That's true, but if you think
he's working for you, you're mistaken.

208
00:14:47,727 --> 00:14:50,446
He's working for himself,
and how hard he works!

209
00:14:50,607 --> 00:14:53,519
- Have you finished?
- No, I have not finished!

210
00:14:53,687 --> 00:14:56,326
His statue is now to be seen
in Pompay's theatre

211
00:14:56,487 --> 00:14:59,206
and replicas of it are all over Rome!

212
00:14:59,367 --> 00:15:03,440
He's built a network of spies
that have spread through the city.

213
00:15:03,607 --> 00:15:08,761
Don't you see? He's building
a prison here, stone by stone,

214
00:15:08,927 --> 00:15:11,487
and one day, when you're gone,
we'll wake up

215
00:15:11,647 --> 00:15:14,115
and find the doors locked
and the bolts down!

216
00:15:15,127 --> 00:15:18,437
Did you have a report to make
on the coastal defences?

217
00:15:18,607 --> 00:15:22,043
- Yes.
- Well. then, make it!

218
00:15:30,327 --> 00:15:35,082
He's interested only in treason
trials and pornographic books

219
00:15:35,247 --> 00:15:38,125
He had one with him.
Caligula had bought it for him.

220
00:15:38,287 --> 00:15:41,882
- They seem to get on well
- He gives me the shudders.

221
00:15:42,047 --> 00:15:45,244
How Germanicus and Agrippina
produced him, I don't know.

222
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:50,242
- Did you quarrel with your father?.
- We had an argument over Sejanus.

223
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:53,126
He's blind to that man's ambition.

224
00:15:53,287 --> 00:15:55,243
- Don't you exaggerate?
- No.

225
00:15:55,407 --> 00:15:58,558
What can he aspire to -
a commander of the guard?

226
00:15:58,727 --> 00:16:03,005
I sometimes think he aspires
to sit where my father sits.

227
00:16:03,167 --> 00:16:06,318
He doesn't realise how much
he depends upon him.

228
00:16:06,487 --> 00:16:08,557
He seeks his advice on everything.

229
00:16:11,167 --> 00:16:14,762
Why don't you go to sleep?

230
00:16:14,927 --> 00:16:18,442
- I don't know why I'm so tired.
- You've had a long journey.

231
00:16:21,567 --> 00:16:25,276
- I came to say goodnight, Father.
- Goodnight.

232
00:16:26,247 --> 00:16:28,044
I'm glad you're back.

233
00:16:28,207 --> 00:16:30,880
I'm sorry I was so tired.
I can't keep awake.

234
00:16:31,047 --> 00:16:34,119
You'll feel better in the morning.
Goodnight, Mother.

235
00:16:34,287 --> 00:16:35,800
Goodnight, Helen.

236
00:16:36,887 --> 00:16:38,718
She's becoming very beautiful

237
00:16:38,887 --> 00:16:42,402
Yes. Her skin's not all
that it should be though.

238
00:16:43,367 --> 00:16:46,723
- You too are looking beautiful
- Thank you.

239
00:16:47,287 --> 00:16:49,164
Why don't you stay?.

240
00:16:49,327 --> 00:16:54,117
Not tonight. You're tired.
You'll sleep better alone.

241
00:16:54,287 --> 00:16:58,838
Yes, you're right.
I really can't keep my ayes open.

242
00:17:02,607 --> 00:17:04,165
- Is he asleep?
- Yes.

243
00:17:04,327 --> 00:17:06,204
- Fast asleep?
- Yes.

244
00:17:13,967 --> 00:17:17,243
- Quick, please.
- No, wait.

245
00:17:17,407 --> 00:17:19,238
Don't be in such a hurry.

246
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:22,038
It's much better if you wait.

247
00:17:24,767 --> 00:17:27,361
Did you do as I said?
Put it in his wine?

248
00:17:27,527 --> 00:17:29,358
Yes. He'll sleep till morning.

249
00:17:39,287 --> 00:17:41,676
I thought you'd never get here.

250
00:17:52,767 --> 00:17:55,235
- What are we going to do?
- Do?

251
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:59,002
We're going to make love
for the last time.

252
00:17:59,967 --> 00:18:01,525
Last time?

253
00:18:02,927 --> 00:18:05,077
No! I couldn't bear it.

254
00:18:05,247 --> 00:18:07,317
- I couldn't bear it!
- Livilla...

255
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:10,320
- He'll go away again.
- It's too much of a risk.

256
00:18:10,487 --> 00:18:13,843
We'll be discovered.
It's too dangerous. Be sensible.

257
00:18:14,007 --> 00:18:18,239
How can you be sensible? I don't
think you love me, not really.

258
00:18:19,447 --> 00:18:24,475
I love you too much to risk
exposing you to a charge of adultery.

259
00:18:25,487 --> 00:18:29,036
Don't tempt me, my darling. Help me.

260
00:18:33,127 --> 00:18:35,038
- We could still meat.
- How?.

261
00:18:35,207 --> 00:18:37,801
- I could do what I did tonight.
- Drug his wine?

262
00:18:37,967 --> 00:18:41,243
He'll get suspicious
if he falls asleep every night.

263
00:18:41,407 --> 00:18:46,242
Besides, his body would grow accustomed
to it and it would cease to have any affect.

264
00:18:47,047 --> 00:18:51,165
And, my darling, one night -
in your eagerness to see him sleep -

265
00:18:52,087 --> 00:18:53,964
you might kill him.

266
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:09,040
Would a large dose really kill him?

267
00:19:09,207 --> 00:19:12,961
- What are you saying?
- I can't live without you.

268
00:19:13,847 --> 00:19:20,798
I can't. I think I'd die if you
didn't come into my bed every night.

269
00:19:22,207 --> 00:19:27,839
It's a little step - from making him
sleep at night to sleeping forever.

270
00:19:28,007 --> 00:19:31,795
- You'll need something stronger.
- Get it for me.

271
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:35,846
- Are you sure?
- Yes! Yes! Are you?

272
00:19:36,007 --> 00:19:37,918
- If you are.
- And afterwards?

273
00:19:38,087 --> 00:19:40,726
I'll divorce my wife
and we'll get married.

274
00:19:40,887 --> 00:19:44,084
And then I'll have you
all to myself.

275
00:19:46,327 --> 00:19:48,397
No more lovers for you, then.

276
00:19:49,407 --> 00:19:51,363
You'll have to behave.

277
00:19:53,047 --> 00:19:55,003
And if I don't?.

278
00:19:55,167 --> 00:20:00,366
If you don't?. Then I'll lock you
in a room without any clothes,

279
00:20:00,527 --> 00:20:03,724
and I'll visit you
three or four times a day.

280
00:20:04,687 --> 00:20:08,999
Perhaps you'll be too tired.
Perhaps you'll only manage once.

281
00:20:09,167 --> 00:20:11,920
Then I'll send my guards
to stand in for me.

282
00:20:12,087 --> 00:20:14,442
- Would you really?.
- Yes.

283
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:18,717
- How many?.
- Three or four.

284
00:20:19,967 --> 00:20:21,798
I might not let them.

285
00:20:22,967 --> 00:20:25,959
- You'll be forced.
- Against my will?.

286
00:20:26,127 --> 00:20:27,526
Yes.

287
00:20:27,687 --> 00:20:30,155
- While you were there?
- Yes.

288
00:20:32,287 --> 00:20:34,721
I'd struggle and scream.

289
00:20:34,887 --> 00:20:36,320
But no use.

290
00:20:38,327 --> 00:20:42,639
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

291
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:00,719
Claudius!

292
00:21:02,007 --> 00:21:03,326
Herod.

293
00:21:06,887 --> 00:21:09,196
- Castor?.
- What's your hurry?.

294
00:21:09,367 --> 00:21:10,800
Oh, yes.

295
00:21:10,967 --> 00:21:13,606
Look at this. It came this morning.

296
00:21:13,767 --> 00:21:17,840
"The Lady Livia Augustus expects
her grandson Tiberius Claudius Drusus

297
00:21:18,007 --> 00:21:21,795
"to dine with her on her birthday.
She hopes he's in good health."

298
00:21:21,967 --> 00:21:24,686
- W-what can it mean?
- What it says, I imagine.

299
00:21:24,847 --> 00:21:26,838
I should take your own wine.

300
00:21:27,007 --> 00:21:30,920
It's no joke, Herod. I'm very
nervous. She never invites me.

301
00:21:31,087 --> 00:21:33,078
We haven't spoken for seven years.

302
00:21:33,247 --> 00:21:37,240
The last time she spoke to me was
when Caligula burned the house down.

303
00:21:37,407 --> 00:21:41,320
Then all she said was, "If you
haven't got a bucket, p-piss on it!"

304
00:21:41,487 --> 00:21:44,957
I remember. Your family
are all lunatics, you know.

305
00:21:45,127 --> 00:21:49,120
In that case, why don't you go back
to your own family in Judea?

306
00:21:49,287 --> 00:21:51,596
I prefer lunatics I know
to ones I don't.

307
00:21:51,767 --> 00:21:55,442
- Where are you off to?
- To find a present for Grandmother.

308
00:21:57,567 --> 00:21:59,603
What about one of these?

309
00:22:00,887 --> 00:22:03,879
I know that face! Who is it?.

310
00:22:04,047 --> 00:22:06,845
He knows that face! Wonderful!

311
00:22:07,007 --> 00:22:09,840
People know that face
better than their own!

312
00:22:10,007 --> 00:22:11,918
Is it Sejanus?

313
00:22:12,087 --> 00:22:15,557
It's a replica of the statue
of him at Pompay Theatre.

314
00:22:15,727 --> 00:22:18,685
- Everyone's buying them.
- Everyone had better!

315
00:22:18,847 --> 00:22:20,644
Here, have one.

316
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:23,646
N-no, thanks.
I've got nowhere to put it.

317
00:22:24,527 --> 00:22:28,839
Oh, don't be obvious, Herod.
It's very tedious. I must go.

318
00:22:29,167 --> 00:22:31,237
Castor, you're not looking well

319
00:22:31,407 --> 00:22:33,796
I've not been well since I returned.

320
00:22:33,967 --> 00:22:35,400
How's Livilla?

321
00:22:35,567 --> 00:22:39,765
I invited her to a p-public reading
of my work, but she never came.

322
00:22:39,927 --> 00:22:41,838
Her tastes have never been literary.

323
00:22:42,007 --> 00:22:45,397
- You never came either.
- That's because mine always were.

324
00:22:45,567 --> 00:22:49,924
Herod, you're talented but d-dull
I must go.

325
00:22:51,527 --> 00:22:54,519
What a dear, divine fool
my cousin is.

326
00:22:54,687 --> 00:22:56,598
How nervous everything makes him.

327
00:22:56,767 --> 00:23:00,282
If I'd been asked to dine with
your grandmother, I'd be nervous!

328
00:23:00,447 --> 00:23:03,041
He's right, you know.
You don't look well

329
00:23:03,207 --> 00:23:06,597
Oh, it'll pass. You worry so much.

330
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,046
Halt!

331
00:23:22,247 --> 00:23:25,603
Silius Caecina. What's this?

332
00:23:25,767 --> 00:23:28,076
I'm to be arrested, it seems.

333
00:23:28,247 --> 00:23:32,604
- By whose order?.
- By order of the State Senate.

334
00:23:33,167 --> 00:23:36,125
- On what grounds?
- On the grounds of treason.

335
00:23:36,287 --> 00:23:39,757
Gaius Silius Caecina is to
be impeached before the Senate.

336
00:23:39,927 --> 00:23:43,681
It seems I made some defamatory
remarks about your father.

337
00:23:44,687 --> 00:23:46,518
I don't recall them.

338
00:23:47,847 --> 00:23:50,680
This must be some sort of joke,
Varro.

339
00:23:50,847 --> 00:23:52,883
You'll be laughed out of the house.

340
00:23:54,167 --> 00:23:56,397
I don't think so.

341
00:23:57,287 --> 00:23:59,403
Please stand aside, sir.

342
00:23:59,567 --> 00:24:03,446
I'm on state business
and may not be interfered with

343
00:24:03,607 --> 00:24:06,280
even by the Emperor's son.

344
00:24:11,207 --> 00:24:12,686
Forward!

345
00:24:24,407 --> 00:24:29,242
O divine Augustus,
take these offerings, poor as they are

346
00:24:29,407 --> 00:24:33,161
and help me, your unworthy successor
to rule wisely in your place.

347
00:24:33,327 --> 00:24:37,400
And help me too, my father,
divine ruler of the world...

348
00:24:37,567 --> 00:24:39,956
to calm the raging spirit inside me,

349
00:24:40,127 --> 00:24:43,039
and lighten the dark shadows
of my soul..

350
00:24:44,367 --> 00:24:46,278
and bring me peace.

351
00:24:47,087 --> 00:24:48,406
Peace.

352
00:24:48,567 --> 00:24:49,920
Hypocrite

353
00:24:50,687 --> 00:24:52,279
Hypocrite.

354
00:24:53,207 --> 00:24:57,837
You sacrifice to Augustus,
but you persecute his grandchildren.

355
00:24:58,887 --> 00:25:02,197
What grandchildren do I persecute
that Augustus didn't?.

356
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:06,042
I'm not talking of my brother
Postumus. I'm talking of me.

357
00:25:06,207 --> 00:25:07,845
Of me!

358
00:25:08,447 --> 00:25:10,756
All my friends, one by one,

359
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:13,646
you either banish
or you charge them with treason.

360
00:25:13,807 --> 00:25:16,401
And their only crime
is friendship for me.

361
00:25:16,567 --> 00:25:19,604
Even Lollia, whom you could find
nothing against,

362
00:25:19,767 --> 00:25:23,077
you degraded and humiliated
till she took her own life!

363
00:25:23,247 --> 00:25:25,317
Now you've arrested Silius Caecina.

364
00:25:25,487 --> 00:25:27,682
If you are not queen,
have I done you wrong?

365
00:25:27,847 --> 00:25:32,125
Why do you persist in this childish
belief that I want to be queen?

366
00:25:32,287 --> 00:25:35,757
Do you need to find reasons
for the way you treat me?

367
00:25:35,927 --> 00:25:40,045
- And how do I treat you?
- You persecute me!

368
00:25:40,567 --> 00:25:44,480
I will not be screamed at even
by the granddaughter of Augustus!

369
00:25:44,647 --> 00:25:48,117
Silius Caecina is charged
with treasonable utterances.

370
00:25:48,287 --> 00:25:49,959
Utterances?

371
00:25:50,127 --> 00:25:52,880
What brings the Emperorship
into disrepute

372
00:25:53,047 --> 00:25:56,005
undermines the foundations
of the state.

373
00:25:59,367 --> 00:26:00,880
Tiberius...

374
00:26:02,287 --> 00:26:06,997
perhaps I do you wrong in thinking
you persecute me through my friends.

375
00:26:08,047 --> 00:26:12,484
But you do me wrong
in thinking me ambitious.

376
00:26:14,207 --> 00:26:16,118
I'm tired.

377
00:26:17,527 --> 00:26:21,520
Since Germanicus died, I've hardly
known what to do with myself.

378
00:26:21,687 --> 00:26:25,566
All I want is to be left alone...

379
00:26:26,367 --> 00:26:27,686
and...

380
00:26:28,247 --> 00:26:29,566
And?

381
00:26:31,207 --> 00:26:35,405
- Be good to my children.
- Have I not been good to them?

382
00:26:35,567 --> 00:26:37,603
To Caligula, perhaps,

383
00:26:37,767 --> 00:26:41,806
but to Nero and Drusus, you're cold
and never enquire after them.

384
00:26:42,487 --> 00:26:47,686
Oh, Tiberius, let's not fight
one another all the time.

385
00:26:49,567 --> 00:26:53,242
As for your children,
they are guiltless of any crime.

386
00:26:54,047 --> 00:26:56,038
I will look upon them as friends.

387
00:26:58,807 --> 00:27:00,399
As for you...

388
00:27:00,567 --> 00:27:05,436
I will never forget
what you made me do to Piso.

389
00:27:16,727 --> 00:27:19,287
Tiberius Claudius Drusus
Nero Germanicus.

390
00:27:19,967 --> 00:27:23,277
Happy b-b-birthday, Grandmother.

391
00:27:25,367 --> 00:27:27,403
Oh, is that for me?

392
00:27:27,567 --> 00:27:32,243
Yes. It's a v-v-vase. From India.

393
00:27:32,407 --> 00:27:36,241
How very pretty.
And from such a distant place.

394
00:27:36,407 --> 00:27:38,398
It's a pity we never got that far.

395
00:27:38,567 --> 00:27:42,560
So many things we could have got cheap.
Sit down, my dear, and eat.

396
00:27:43,127 --> 00:27:45,846
- C-Caligula.
- Uncle.

397
00:27:54,287 --> 00:27:56,278
T-t-to you, Grandmother.

398
00:28:28,527 --> 00:28:31,360
Staking everything on one throw,
Uncle Claudius?

399
00:28:31,527 --> 00:28:32,880
Hold your tongue.

400
00:28:33,047 --> 00:28:37,120
That was a gesture of confidence
in me and was much appreciated.

401
00:28:37,287 --> 00:28:41,075
Have you had l-lots
of lovely presents, Grandmother?.

402
00:28:41,247 --> 00:28:46,799
Several. my dear. Thrasyllus has
drawn the most detailed horoscope.

403
00:28:46,967 --> 00:28:48,958
Such work has gone into it. Amazing.

404
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:53,279
A horoscope full of incident and prophecy.
I was amazed at it myself.

405
00:28:53,447 --> 00:28:55,756
It was a present from Tiberius.

406
00:28:55,927 --> 00:28:58,964
He wanted to know how much longer
I'm going to live.

407
00:28:59,127 --> 00:29:01,163
- I assure you...
- Oh, shut up.

408
00:29:01,327 --> 00:29:04,000
It's a foolish mother
who doesn't know her son.

409
00:29:04,167 --> 00:29:08,160
- And d-did he find out?.
- Yes, yes. I shall die soon.

410
00:29:08,327 --> 00:29:11,842
Next year some time.
My son will be relieved.

411
00:29:12,007 --> 00:29:16,558
I shall tell him nothing. It would
be a breach of professional ethics.

412
00:29:16,727 --> 00:29:20,561
You're a liar. Like all good
astrologers, you're a liar.

413
00:29:20,727 --> 00:29:25,084
You can go now. They tell
the truth about the future,

414
00:29:25,247 --> 00:29:27,556
but lie their way
out of the present.

415
00:29:27,727 --> 00:29:29,957
Let me reassure you, I could be wrong.

416
00:29:30,127 --> 00:29:35,804
If you're mistaken over the exact
time of your birth by a fraction,

417
00:29:35,967 --> 00:29:38,003
it could mean another ten years.

418
00:29:38,167 --> 00:29:40,397
You see, he can't resist it.

419
00:29:40,567 --> 00:29:45,516
They’re all insecure, astrologers.
They all want to be loved.

420
00:29:45,687 --> 00:29:48,645
Go away, Thrasyllus,
you'll get no love here.

421
00:29:48,807 --> 00:29:52,846
What are you grinning at, monster?.
You are a monster, aren't you?

422
00:29:53,007 --> 00:29:55,282
Whatever you say, Great Grandmother.

423
00:29:55,447 --> 00:29:57,677
Did you know he was a monster,
Claudius?

424
00:29:57,847 --> 00:30:00,600
Is he old enough
to have acquired that t-title?

425
00:30:00,767 --> 00:30:04,919
He started very young,
didn't you, monster?.

426
00:30:05,967 --> 00:30:09,846
I searched his room one day
and I found a little green talisman

427
00:30:10,007 --> 00:30:13,682
that told me
a very remarkable story -

428
00:30:13,847 --> 00:30:16,964
or confirmed one
I'd heard from another quarter.

429
00:30:17,127 --> 00:30:20,005
A g-green talisman?
Like my brother wore?

430
00:30:20,647 --> 00:30:23,207
The one your brother wore.

431
00:30:23,367 --> 00:30:27,406
Do you think it's safe that Uncle Claudius
should be told my secret?.

432
00:30:27,567 --> 00:30:30,127
Or are you going to poison him?

433
00:30:30,287 --> 00:30:32,403
Oh, he's quite safe.

434
00:30:32,567 --> 00:30:34,956
And remember this, monster,

435
00:30:35,127 --> 00:30:37,880
your Uncle Claudius here
is a phenomenon.

436
00:30:38,047 --> 00:30:42,325
Because he's sworn
to protect his brother's children,

437
00:30:42,487 --> 00:30:45,638
he will never harm you.
And remember this too.

438
00:30:45,807 --> 00:30:49,356
Thrasyllus has prophesied
that he will avenge your death,

439
00:30:49,527 --> 00:30:52,280
so you cannot harm him.

440
00:30:52,447 --> 00:30:54,438
I didn't think much of that.

441
00:30:54,607 --> 00:30:57,565
Never mind what you thought,
just remember it.

442
00:30:57,727 --> 00:31:02,005
Now you may go. I want
to talk to Claudius in private.

443
00:31:28,767 --> 00:31:30,758
Goodnight, Great Grandmother.

444
00:31:34,327 --> 00:31:36,045
Goodnight, Uncle.

445
00:31:36,207 --> 00:31:41,122
My body fascinates him
because it's so old.

446
00:31:41,287 --> 00:31:43,596
You'd think it would repel him.

447
00:31:43,767 --> 00:31:47,157
Why do you allow him
such f-f-familiarity?.

448
00:31:47,327 --> 00:31:49,124
Because it pleases him.

449
00:31:50,207 --> 00:31:52,721
And because he will be
the next Emperor.

450
00:31:55,207 --> 00:31:57,277
You don't believe me, do you?

451
00:31:59,487 --> 00:32:02,001
If you say so, Grandmother.

452
00:32:02,567 --> 00:32:06,082
You know I don't concern myself
with high p-politics,

453
00:32:06,247 --> 00:32:10,399
but what about Castor?.
And Caligula has two older brothers.

454
00:32:10,567 --> 00:32:13,525
Castor is ill
Thrasyllus says he won't recover.

455
00:32:13,687 --> 00:32:18,397
He also says that Tiberius will
choose Caligula to succeed him.

456
00:32:18,567 --> 00:32:20,159
Why?.

457
00:32:20,327 --> 00:32:21,840
Vanity.

458
00:32:22,007 --> 00:32:27,923
Tiberius wants to be loved -
at least after his death if not before.

459
00:32:28,087 --> 00:32:30,078
And the best way to ensure that...

460
00:32:30,247 --> 00:32:35,116
Is to have someone w=worse
to follow him. Well. he's certainly no fool

461
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:37,403
He's the biggest fool in my family.

462
00:32:37,567 --> 00:32:42,766
I always thought that was you...
but I think now I was wrong.

463
00:32:47,967 --> 00:32:50,276
Grandmother, after all these years,

464
00:32:50,447 --> 00:32:53,200
you didn't invite me to dinner
to tell me this.

465
00:32:53,367 --> 00:32:55,085
Wine has made you bold.

466
00:32:55,247 --> 00:32:58,637
You kept in with Caligula
because he is the next Emperor.

467
00:32:58,807 --> 00:33:01,685
- Lost your stutter too.
- But if you're dead,

468
00:33:01,847 --> 00:33:03,838
what difference can it make to you?

469
00:33:04,007 --> 00:33:07,886
Oh, it makes a lot of difference.

470
00:33:09,327 --> 00:33:12,000
And that's really why you're here.

471
00:33:15,007 --> 00:33:17,999
I want to be a goddess, Claudius.

472
00:33:19,847 --> 00:33:22,407
Thrasyllus says he's sure I will be,

473
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:25,684
which means he's not sure,
he just thinks I will

474
00:33:25,847 --> 00:33:28,122
Why are you so anxious
to be a goddess?

475
00:33:28,287 --> 00:33:30,403
Oh, don't you understand?

476
00:33:31,807 --> 00:33:36,119
Do you believe that the souls
of criminals suffer eternal torment?.

477
00:33:36,287 --> 00:33:37,686
Certainly.

478
00:33:37,847 --> 00:33:41,522
But that the immortal gods
are free from fear of punishment?.

479
00:33:41,687 --> 00:33:45,919
Of course. Jove deposed his father,
killed one of his grandsons

480
00:33:46,087 --> 00:33:49,602
and married his own sister.
He's the greatest god of all

481
00:33:52,007 --> 00:33:55,363
I've done many terrible things,
Claudius.

482
00:33:56,287 --> 00:33:58,926
No ruler could do otherwise.

483
00:33:59,087 --> 00:34:03,399
But I've always put the good
of the Empire above all else.

484
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:07,682
Who saved Rome from civil war again?
I did.

485
00:34:07,847 --> 00:34:11,601
Augustus would have plunged us
into it time and again

486
00:34:11,767 --> 00:34:14,565
with his ridiculous favouritism.

487
00:34:14,727 --> 00:34:17,480
He set Agrippa against Marcellus,

488
00:34:17,647 --> 00:34:20,878
Gaius against Tiberius,
Tiberius against Postumus.

489
00:34:21,047 --> 00:34:23,277
There was no end to his follies.

490
00:34:23,447 --> 00:34:25,756
And it fell to me to...

491
00:34:27,207 --> 00:34:30,358
remove them - one by one.

492
00:34:32,047 --> 00:34:37,644
Don't say you never suspected.
That's why I tolerate Caligula.

493
00:34:37,807 --> 00:34:41,083
He's sworn, if I keep his secret...

494
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:45,883
he'll make me a goddess
as soon as he becomes Emperor.

495
00:34:46,727 --> 00:34:51,437
You too must swear that you'll do
all you can to see it happens.

496
00:34:52,567 --> 00:34:54,364
Don't you see?

497
00:34:54,527 --> 00:34:59,555
If he doesn't make me a goddess,
I'll be in hell. Hell

498
00:34:59,727 --> 00:35:05,518
Suffering torments day and night,
year after year after year.

499
00:35:06,527 --> 00:35:09,599
Grandmother,
p-please don't distress yourself.

500
00:35:09,767 --> 00:35:12,565
Of course I'll do what I can.

501
00:35:12,727 --> 00:35:15,241
- Thank you.
- On one small condition.

502
00:35:15,407 --> 00:35:18,205
You see, there's so much
I want to know.

503
00:35:18,367 --> 00:35:21,723
I'm an historian
and I want to know the truth.

504
00:35:21,887 --> 00:35:24,606
When people die,
so much dies with them,

505
00:35:24,767 --> 00:35:28,282
and all that's left are pieces
of paper that tell lies.

506
00:35:28,447 --> 00:35:30,199
Lies, lies.

507
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:34,966
He wants to know the truth
and he calls it a small condition.

508
00:35:35,447 --> 00:35:39,076
Grandmother, who killed Marcellus?

509
00:35:42,887 --> 00:35:44,605
I did.

510
00:35:46,687 --> 00:35:50,919
The Empire needed Agrippa
more than it needed Marcellus.

511
00:35:52,767 --> 00:35:55,122
And then I poisoned Agrippa later

512
00:35:55,287 --> 00:35:59,883
because I knew that his wife
was in love with Tiberius,

513
00:36:00,047 --> 00:36:03,881
and if Tiberius married her
Augustus would make him Emperor.

514
00:36:04,047 --> 00:36:06,083
My son botched that up, of course.

515
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:11,002
And J-Julia's sons by Agrippa.
How did they die?

516
00:36:12,887 --> 00:36:16,675
Gaius I had poisoned
when he was in Syria.

517
00:36:18,647 --> 00:36:20,638
You have a long reach.

518
00:36:20,807 --> 00:36:23,162
The Empire's very large. I need one.

519
00:36:23,967 --> 00:36:27,721
Lucius was drowned
in a boating accident

520
00:36:27,887 --> 00:36:30,037
arranged by his friend Plautius.

521
00:36:30,807 --> 00:36:33,605
And Postumus?

522
00:36:35,647 --> 00:36:39,276
- You were fond of him, weren't you?
- Yes, Grandmother.

523
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:44,157
He was useless. I had to get rid
of him. He was a threat to Tiberius.

524
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:47,285
Besides, he knew
I'd had his mother banished.

525
00:36:48,527 --> 00:36:52,361
And what about my father,
who was your son,

526
00:36:52,527 --> 00:36:56,759
and Germanicus, who was my dear
brother - did you poison them?

527
00:36:57,887 --> 00:36:59,286
No.

528
00:36:59,447 --> 00:37:02,484
Your father died of his wound.

529
00:37:03,367 --> 00:37:07,963
Plancina poisoned Germanicus
without instructions from me.

530
00:37:09,407 --> 00:37:12,080
But I'd marked them both down
for death.

531
00:37:12,847 --> 00:37:14,360
Why?.

532
00:37:15,207 --> 00:37:20,486
They were both infected with that
disorder known as republicanism.

533
00:37:21,167 --> 00:37:24,557
- So was I.
- Yes, but you didn't count.

534
00:37:26,607 --> 00:37:30,646
If I ever had the opportunity,
do you know the first thing I'd do?

535
00:37:30,807 --> 00:37:33,116
Restore the Republic.

536
00:37:33,287 --> 00:37:35,721
Then you are a fool. after all

537
00:37:37,687 --> 00:37:42,715
And what about Augustus?
Did you poison him?

538
00:37:47,767 --> 00:37:49,086
Yes.

539
00:37:51,327 --> 00:37:52,965
Yes, I did.

540
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:59,402
I smeared the poison on the figs
while they were still on the tree.

541
00:37:59,567 --> 00:38:01,523
I had no choice.

542
00:38:01,687 --> 00:38:04,884
He would only eat them
if he'd picked them himself.

543
00:38:06,727 --> 00:38:08,718
It took me all night to do it.

544
00:38:08,887 --> 00:38:11,924
How could you have done that,
Grandmother,

545
00:38:12,087 --> 00:38:14,521
when you'd lived with him
for so long?

546
00:38:15,487 --> 00:38:19,366
Yes. That was hard.

547
00:38:20,407 --> 00:38:21,920
Very hard.

548
00:38:23,967 --> 00:38:27,403
That was the hardest thing
I ever had to do.

549
00:38:32,607 --> 00:38:38,239
Oh, you've made me tired with all
your questions. You must go away.

550
00:38:42,607 --> 00:38:44,040
Take this.

551
00:38:46,527 --> 00:38:48,324
Read it some time.

552
00:38:48,487 --> 00:38:54,596
That is a collection of Sihylline verses
rejected from the official book.

553
00:38:54,767 --> 00:38:56,166
Why?.

554
00:38:56,327 --> 00:39:03,278
Because it's prophesied there
that you will one day be Emperor.

555
00:39:08,207 --> 00:39:09,640
Yes.

556
00:39:10,167 --> 00:39:11,566
You.

557
00:39:13,367 --> 00:39:15,517
Anything you say, Grandmother.

558
00:39:17,927 --> 00:39:22,045
- You won't forget your promise?
- No, I won't.

559
00:39:25,727 --> 00:39:27,718
If I can become Emperor,

560
00:39:27,887 --> 00:39:31,118
you can certainly
become the Queen of Heaven!

561
00:39:31,287 --> 00:39:32,686
(HE LAUGHS)

562
00:39:32,847 --> 00:39:34,963
Tiberius Claudius Drusus Nero Germanicus

563
00:39:37,567 --> 00:39:39,956
Claudius, dear fellow.
How nice to see you.

564
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:43,324
I w=was on my way to see Castor.
I'm told he's v-very bad.

565
00:39:43,487 --> 00:39:48,197
Yes, but he'll recover, I'm sure.
Your sister is taking care of him.

566
00:39:48,367 --> 00:39:51,245
Actually, I wanted
to have a word with you.

567
00:39:53,367 --> 00:39:55,039
What about?.

568
00:39:55,847 --> 00:39:58,839
This may seem an odd question
to put to a husband,

569
00:39:59,007 --> 00:40:01,475
but did you know
your wife was pregnant?.

570
00:40:02,967 --> 00:40:04,400
No.

571
00:40:04,567 --> 00:40:07,957
N-n-no, I d-didn't.

572
00:40:08,847 --> 00:40:11,805
- How do you know?.
- I know.

573
00:40:11,967 --> 00:40:14,481
Well. it's n-nothing to do with me.

574
00:40:14,647 --> 00:40:17,286
We haven't even s-spoken
for a long time.

575
00:40:18,047 --> 00:40:20,561
- You'll have to divorce her.
- What for?.

576
00:40:20,727 --> 00:40:24,845
You can't be married to a woman
who's bearing someone else's child.

577
00:40:25,007 --> 00:40:27,475
Your uncle will expect you
to divorce her.

578
00:40:27,647 --> 00:40:33,165
Oh. Well. of course
I'll d-d-divorce her.

579
00:40:35,527 --> 00:40:39,918
- Whom will you marry?.
- M-marry?. I'm getting d-divorced.

580
00:40:40,087 --> 00:40:42,282
But you won't want to live alone.

581
00:40:42,447 --> 00:40:44,961
I was l-living alone
when I was m-married.

582
00:40:45,127 --> 00:40:48,403
Then it doesn't matter
whether you marry or not.

583
00:40:49,287 --> 00:40:51,721
- I'd rather not.
- Nonsense.

584
00:40:51,887 --> 00:40:54,606
I have just the woman for you.

585
00:40:55,687 --> 00:40:59,919
Beautiful. independent -
she'll leave you alone when you like.

586
00:41:00,087 --> 00:41:06,003
- W-who is she?
- My sister. Aelia.

587
00:41:07,247 --> 00:41:14,085
Well. she w=wouldn't w=want
to marry a lame, sick fool like me.

588
00:41:14,247 --> 00:41:15,885
She wouldn't mind.

589
00:41:16,047 --> 00:41:19,517
You're the Emperor's nephew.
That's a good alliance.

590
00:41:19,687 --> 00:41:22,918
And on your side,
you'd be my brother-in-law.

591
00:41:23,847 --> 00:41:27,157
I've spoken to the Emperor.
He's given his consent.

592
00:41:27,927 --> 00:41:31,476
Oh, in that case,
anything you say, Sejanus.

593
00:41:31,647 --> 00:41:33,797
Good! Well. that's settled.

594
00:41:33,967 --> 00:41:37,721
That's very decent of you, Sejanus.
Thanks a lot.

595
00:41:40,967 --> 00:41:44,323
(LIVILLA) He's dying. Dying.

596
00:42:30,967 --> 00:42:34,039
I asked to see the Emperor to convey
my sympathies on his son's death.

597
00:42:34,207 --> 00:42:37,040
He sent word he never
wanted to see me again.

598
00:42:37,207 --> 00:42:39,641
A nod is as good as a wink
from there!

599
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:43,117
Where will you go, Herod?
Back to Judea?

600
00:42:43,287 --> 00:42:47,644
No, no. To Edom. My grandfather,
Herod the Great came from there.

601
00:42:47,807 --> 00:42:51,720
It was your father, Mark Antony,
who made him King of the Jews.

602
00:42:51,887 --> 00:42:56,085
He did them no favour. He did
my grandfather no favour either.

603
00:42:56,247 --> 00:42:58,886
The Jews drive all their rulers mad.

604
00:42:59,047 --> 00:43:02,881
What will you do in Edom?
I understand there's nothing there.

605
00:43:03,047 --> 00:43:05,038
Oh, I shall.. You know.

606
00:43:06,047 --> 00:43:10,165
Grandfather's domains were divided
among his three surviving sons.

607
00:43:10,327 --> 00:43:14,036
That he had three left is a miracle
for he murdered the rest.

608
00:43:14,207 --> 00:43:17,483
- I think he overlooked them!
- A colourful character.

609
00:43:17,647 --> 00:43:20,161
If black is colourful.
he was colourful

610
00:43:20,327 --> 00:43:25,481
From there, I shall decide which of
my three uncles is the safest touch

611
00:43:25,647 --> 00:43:28,605
- and make my plans accordingly.
- You must marry.

612
00:43:28,767 --> 00:43:31,156
- I have someone in mind.
- A Roman?

613
00:43:31,327 --> 00:43:35,206
No, Lady. We Jews believe
in marrying only among ourselves.

614
00:43:35,367 --> 00:43:38,165
- You're a very arrogant people.
- Practical

615
00:43:38,327 --> 00:43:42,559
There are so many things we can't eat!
No Gentile woman would stand it!

616
00:43:43,767 --> 00:43:46,565
What's this, Claudius,
about your marriage?

617
00:43:46,727 --> 00:43:49,525
(ANTONIA) For Claudius?
He's already married.

618
00:43:49,687 --> 00:43:53,805
(AGRIPPINA) But he's getting
a divorce to marry Sejanus' sister.

619
00:43:56,247 --> 00:43:58,078
Is this true?

620
00:43:58,247 --> 00:44:00,283
Well. I...

621
00:44:01,167 --> 00:44:05,479
S-S-Sejanus t-t...

622
00:44:05,647 --> 00:44:07,160
Oh, get it out!

623
00:44:07,327 --> 00:44:12,959
My wife, Urganalilla, is apparently
having a baby and it's not mine.

624
00:44:13,127 --> 00:44:16,802
- It wouldn't be. You never see her.
- That's the p-point.

625
00:44:16,967 --> 00:44:22,280
So Sejanus suggested I divorce her
and m-m-marry his sister.

626
00:44:23,567 --> 00:44:28,800
I've never heard anything
so monstrously wicked in all my life.

627
00:44:28,967 --> 00:44:31,117
You're a bigger fool than I thought.

628
00:44:31,287 --> 00:44:35,758
Well. w=what difference does it make
to me? I shan't see her either.

629
00:44:35,927 --> 00:44:38,919
Fool Germanicus would have had
no patience with you.

630
00:44:39,087 --> 00:44:40,520
P-probably.

631
00:44:40,687 --> 00:44:43,918
Can't you see the vile ambition
that drives that man?

632
00:44:44,087 --> 00:44:46,078
It's just another step on the way.

633
00:44:46,247 --> 00:44:49,762
By this marriage, he relates himself
to the Imperial family.

634
00:44:49,927 --> 00:44:51,997
Then does he plan to marry Livilla?

635
00:44:52,167 --> 00:44:55,159
- What has he to do with Livilla?
- He's her lover.

636
00:44:55,327 --> 00:44:57,318
Sejanus is married with children!

637
00:44:57,487 --> 00:45:01,605
What kind of world
do you think we're living in?!

638
00:45:04,807 --> 00:45:07,799
I'm sorry. I'm upset.

639
00:45:09,647 --> 00:45:11,365
Castor's dead.

640
00:45:11,527 --> 00:45:16,043
Silius Caecina committed suicide
even before the trial had ended.

641
00:45:17,087 --> 00:45:19,442
One by one my friends vanish.

642
00:45:20,807 --> 00:45:22,718
Where will it end?

643
00:45:24,287 --> 00:45:28,200
- You've betrayed us!
- Oh, Pina...

644
00:45:28,367 --> 00:45:30,437
(ANTONIA) Why did you agree to it?.

645
00:45:32,007 --> 00:45:35,204
Well.. He asked me.

646
00:45:36,967 --> 00:45:41,802
Is that all you can say?.
You blockhead!

647
00:45:42,887 --> 00:45:47,005
No. He's not a blockhead.

648
00:45:48,647 --> 00:45:50,683
It's we who are the blockheads.

649
00:45:50,847 --> 00:45:54,044
If Sejanus had come to us
with a proposal like that,

650
00:45:54,207 --> 00:45:57,404
we'd have said no,
but Claudius knows better.

651
00:45:58,687 --> 00:46:03,363
Claudius sways and bends
with each little wind that blows.

652
00:46:03,527 --> 00:46:06,883
- You mean he's weak and cowardly.
- Perhaps.

653
00:46:07,047 --> 00:46:09,686
But at least he's still here!

654
00:46:10,167 --> 00:46:13,125
(OLD CLAUDIUS)
But at least he's still here.

655
00:46:13,287 --> 00:46:15,721
Yes Still here.

656
00:46:16,647 --> 00:46:19,844
And they've all gone,
every one of them.

657
00:46:20,967 --> 00:46:22,958
it's like a dream -

658
00:46:23,127 --> 00:46:28,155
dreamed by Livia
sleeping fitfully down in hell

659
00:46:29,807 --> 00:46:34,039
No. Livia is dying.

660
00:46:35,287 --> 00:46:36,640
Dying.

661
00:46:37,727 --> 00:46:42,198
The mother of the nation is dying.

662
00:46:44,607 --> 00:46:48,077
Livia is dying. She's sent for you.

663
00:46:48,247 --> 00:46:52,320
She wants to see you.
Why, I can't imagine.

664
00:46:53,527 --> 00:46:55,279
- Dying?
- Yes.

665
00:46:56,367 --> 00:46:58,403
But it was only a cold.

666
00:46:58,567 --> 00:47:01,445
It's settled on her lungs.
She's sinking fast.

667
00:47:01,607 --> 00:47:03,677
She's asked to see you.

668
00:47:05,647 --> 00:47:09,401
Well. are you going to sit there
all night?.

669
00:47:09,967 --> 00:47:12,640
I hear you're dying,
Great Grandmother.

670
00:47:14,647 --> 00:47:19,323
You won't forget your promise,
will you?

671
00:47:20,647 --> 00:47:22,638
To make you a goddess?

672
00:47:24,887 --> 00:47:28,800
What makes you think a smelly
old woman could become a goddess?

673
00:47:30,767 --> 00:47:34,157
I don't need you any more, you see,
Great Grandmother.

674
00:47:34,807 --> 00:47:36,923
My secret will die with you.

675
00:47:37,567 --> 00:47:41,196
You're going to stew in hell
for ever and ever.

676
00:47:44,207 --> 00:47:46,243
Let me tell you something.

677
00:47:53,647 --> 00:47:56,639
Thrasyllus has made
another prophecy.

678
00:47:57,687 --> 00:47:59,678
He told Tiberius.

679
00:48:00,687 --> 00:48:02,837
He said one who is going to die soon

680
00:48:03,007 --> 00:48:06,317
will become the greatest god
the world has ever known.

681
00:48:06,487 --> 00:48:10,719
No temples will be dedicated
to anyone but him in the whole world.

682
00:48:12,327 --> 00:48:14,158
Not even to Augustus.

683
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:18,361
And do you know who that one is?

684
00:48:19,567 --> 00:48:21,046
Me.

685
00:48:22,727 --> 00:48:24,365
Me.

686
00:48:26,207 --> 00:48:28,846
I shall become
the greatest god of all.

687
00:48:29,007 --> 00:48:33,683
and I shall look down on you,
suffering all the torments of hell.

688
00:48:33,847 --> 00:48:35,963
and I shall say...

689
00:48:36,767 --> 00:48:38,758
"Leave her there.

690
00:48:40,207 --> 00:48:42,960
"Leave her there
for ever and ever and ever."

691
00:48:53,407 --> 00:48:55,841
Goodbye, Great Grandmother.

692
00:48:57,407 --> 00:48:59,523
How are you, Grandmother?.

693
00:49:03,007 --> 00:49:05,237
D-don't cry.

694
00:49:08,727 --> 00:49:10,638
He was here...

695
00:49:11,687 --> 00:49:14,645
Caligula was here.

696
00:49:16,567 --> 00:49:22,403
He said he wouldn't make me
a goddess.

697
00:49:24,887 --> 00:49:28,038
I'll see that he does, Grandmother.

698
00:49:29,447 --> 00:49:31,642
He said...

699
00:49:32,167 --> 00:49:37,560
He said he'd leave me
to stew in hell

700
00:49:39,607 --> 00:49:42,963
I want to be a goddess, Claudius.

701
00:49:44,087 --> 00:49:46,078
I deserve it.

702
00:49:47,527 --> 00:49:50,246
You shall be the Queen of Heaven.

703
00:49:51,407 --> 00:49:53,238
I promise you.

704
00:49:54,447 --> 00:49:57,962
- Really?.
- Yes.

705
00:50:00,687 --> 00:50:04,839
Go on playing the fool. Claudius.

706
00:50:09,167 --> 00:50:12,603
Stay with me till I go.

707
00:50:15,567 --> 00:50:17,956
Put a coin in my mouth...

708
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:21,123
to pay the ferryman...

709
00:50:22,247 --> 00:50:24,238
for the journey.

710
00:50:52,207 --> 00:50:54,402
Goodbye, Grandmother.

711
00:50:57,047 --> 00:50:58,924
Safe journey.
