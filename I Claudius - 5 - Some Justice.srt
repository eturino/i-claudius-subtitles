than to live under a cloud.

that it's you they hate and not me?

There is nothing in this world
that occurs to you

83

That is the affliction I live with.

Dearly as I loved my son, I can't
believe what you're saying.

Piso, yes, we all know his record.
But Tiberius?

87
00:08:41,647 --> 00:08:44,764
Then why did he appoint Piso
Governor of Syria?

88
00:08:44,927 --> 00:08:47,361
There were others
he could have chosen.

89

It wasn't a good choice,
I grant you,

90
00:08:50,727 --> 00:08:55,278
but I can't believe that an Emperor
of Rome would stoop to such methods.

91
00:08:55,447 --> 00:08:58,359
Those are his methods.
He doesn't need to stoop.

92
00:08:58,527 --> 00:09:01,087
I'm sorry, Castor.
I know he's your father.

93
00:09:01,247 --> 00:09:06,196
Say it. You can say nothing against
my father that I've not said myself.

94
00:09:06,367 --> 00:09:09,803
It's not for us to accuse
the Emperor. We have no proof.

95
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:14,518
Proof! The people won't need proof.
The people know. They’re not fools.

96
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:18,805
I've told the prosecutor to prepare
charges against Piso and Plancina.

97
00:09:18,967 --> 00:09:22,801
- On what gr-grounds?
- Treason and murder.

98
00:09:22,967 --> 00:09:26,243
- Is there really proof of murder?.
- And of witchery.

99
00:09:26,407 --> 00:09:31,640
Is it possible? Barbarian Jew
that I am, I find it incredible

100
00:09:31,807 --> 00:09:34,685
that sophisticated people
believe in witchery.

101
00:09:34,847 --> 00:09:38,317
Oh, scoff all you like, Herod,
but judge for yourself.

102
00:09:39,447 --> 00:09:43,360
On our return to Syria from Egypt,
Germanicus fell ill

103
00:09:43,527 --> 00:09:47,645
and suspected that Plancina had
bribed her way into our kitchens

104
00:09:47,807 --> 00:09:50,401
- and had his food poisoned.
- But why?.

105
00:09:50,567 --> 00:09:54,082
Because Germanicus
had dismissed her husband, Piso.

106
00:09:55,047 --> 00:09:59,404
So I prepared all his food myself,
but he was able to eat very little.

107
00:10:00,487 --> 00:10:03,843
He complained that there
was a smell of death in the house,

108
00:10:04,007 --> 00:10:08,683
and began to believe that Plancina
was using witchcraft against him.

109
00:10:09,767 --> 00:10:13,680
He made a propitiating sacrifice
of nine black puppies to Hecate...

110
00:10:14,687 --> 00:10:18,202
..which was the proper thing to do
when being victimised.

111
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:20,437
And the very next day,

112
00:10:20,607 --> 00:10:24,316
a slave who was washing the floor
noticed a loose tile.

113
00:10:24,527 --> 00:10:29,885
Lifting it up, he saw beneath it
the naked and decaying corpse of a baby,

114
00:10:30,807 --> 00:10:34,436
its belly painted red
with horns tied to its forehead.

115
00:10:35,327 --> 00:10:39,445
We searched every room
and equally gruesome finds were made.

116
00:10:40,447 --> 00:10:44,235
The corpse of a cat with rudimentary
wings growing in its back.

117
00:10:45,207 --> 00:10:49,166
The head of a negro with a child's
white hand stuck in its mouth.

118
00:10:49,327 --> 00:10:53,366
The skull of an ass with the word
Germanicus written across it.

119
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:57,679
Oh, cock's feathers smeared in blood
were found among the cushions.

120
00:10:58,527 --> 00:11:01,087
The word Rome written upside down.

121
00:11:02,127 --> 00:11:04,118
And the number 17.

122
00:11:05,167 --> 00:11:09,797
Only I knew that the number 17
upset him dreadfully.

123
00:11:12,367 --> 00:11:14,961
(HEROD) Plancina must have had
accomplices.

124
00:11:15,127 --> 00:11:18,517
There could not have been.
The woman dabbles in witchcraft!

125

(CLAUDIUS) Go on, Pina.

126
00:11:21,767 --> 00:11:25,646
One of the things that upset him most
was the appearance of his name,

127
00:11:25,807 --> 00:11:28,446
each day shortened by a letter.

128
00:11:28,607 --> 00:11:31,758
It would appear quite suddenly
without explanation

129
00:11:31,927 --> 00:11:34,600
in rooms to which the servants
had no access

130
00:11:34,767 --> 00:11:38,646
and where the windows were too small
for a man to climb through.

131
00:11:38,807 --> 00:11:40,843
He told me he was doomed.

132
00:11:41,007 --> 00:11:46,127
I told him not as long as he had
the green jasper charm of Hecate.

133
00:11:46,287 --> 00:11:48,926
It was under his pillow
and that comforted him.

134
00:11:49,087 --> 00:11:53,285
He knew as long as he had that,
nothing could happen to him.

135
00:11:53,447 --> 00:11:56,120
That night, while he was asleep,

136
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:59,643
he felt a tiny movement
under his pillow.

137
00:12:00,607 --> 00:12:04,077
He turned on his side
and fumbled for the charm.

138
00:12:05,047 --> 00:12:06,799
It was gone.

139
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:11,280
Tell me, Herod,
how did it disappear?.

140
00:12:11,447 --> 00:12:14,086
Nobody but myself
was allowed in that room.

141
00:12:14,247 --> 00:12:16,966
Who could have taken it?. Who?

142
00:12:19,767 --> 00:12:22,839
Caligula, darling,
what are you doing out of bed?

143
00:12:23,727 --> 00:12:27,766
- I've had a bad dream, Mother.
- Oh, my poor baby. Come here.

144
00:12:28,687 --> 00:12:31,440
- What did you dream?
- Horrid dream.

145
00:12:31,607 --> 00:12:35,361
I dreamt there were bats
sitting along the shelf in my room.

146
00:12:35,527 --> 00:12:39,645
Then they flew down and sat on me
until I was all covered with them

147
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:42,560
- and no one could see me any more.
- Poor baby.

148
00:12:42,727 --> 00:12:46,686
- You shouldn't eat before bed.
- Mother, he's been through so much!

149
00:12:46,847 --> 00:12:48,917
He stuffs himself with things.

150
00:12:49,087 --> 00:12:52,966
Perhaps he'd like to sleep with Drusillus?
He'd be company for him.

151
00:12:53,127 --> 00:12:55,482
Would you like to sleep
with your cousin?

152
00:12:55,647 --> 00:12:59,196
- I'd rather sleep with Drusilla.
- Drusilla? Your sister?.

153
00:12:59,367 --> 00:13:01,756
At your age?
What is the world coming to?

154
00:13:01,927 --> 00:13:04,964
- He doesn't mean it.
- He's been too long in the East.

155
00:13:05,127 --> 00:13:08,164
Syria is no place
to bring up a Roman child.

156
00:13:08,327 --> 00:13:12,161
- I don't like it here.
- You'll have to get used to it.

157
00:13:12,327 --> 00:13:15,364
What was so wonderful
about the East?.

158
00:13:18,007 --> 00:13:20,316
Herod Agrippa is talking to you,
child!

159
00:13:21,207 --> 00:13:24,916
It was full of strange
and mysterious people and things.

160
00:13:25,087 --> 00:13:28,238
The Syrians made a great fuss
of him, I'm afraid.

161
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:31,717
He wandered all over Antioch
with the house slaves.

162
00:13:31,887 --> 00:13:33,605
Too much freedom.

163
00:13:33,767 --> 00:13:36,565
I don't think so.
His father was very strict.

164
00:13:37,767 --> 00:13:41,442
Would you like to sleep in your
cousin's room as Claudius suggests?

165
00:13:41,607 --> 00:13:44,724
- I'll go to my own room.
- I'll take him. Say goodnight.

166
00:13:44,887 --> 00:13:46,240
Goodnight.

167
00:13:50,607 --> 00:13:52,598
He's very overwrought.

168
00:13:53,167 --> 00:13:56,079
Now, what about the t-t-trial?.

169
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:59,485
Do you think you can prove
a charge of poisoning?

170
00:13:59,647 --> 00:14:01,478
We have a witness - Martina.

171
00:14:01,647 --> 00:14:05,356
She's a notorious poisoner
and was seen often with Plancina.

172
00:14:05,527 --> 00:14:07,882
- Where is she?
- On her way to R-Rome.

173
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:10,880
She's being kept hidden
in different places.

174
00:14:11,047 --> 00:14:13,163
We must find a place for her here.

175
00:14:13,327 --> 00:14:15,636
Sejanus' agents are looking for her.

176
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:19,436
I know a place. A house
of a merchant friend of mine.

177
00:14:19,607 --> 00:14:23,725
Good. I've applied for permission
to prosecute in the courts.

178
00:14:23,887 --> 00:14:26,481
Oh, I think
that's n-not a good idea.

179
00:14:27,207 --> 00:14:30,438
Better in the courts
than in the Senate by my father.

180
00:14:30,607 --> 00:14:33,201
He can f-fix the courts
behind the scenes.

181
00:14:33,367 --> 00:14:40,239
If he's tried in the Senate by him,
T-T-Tiberius will be on trial too.

182
00:14:40,407 --> 00:14:43,160
Clever, Clau-Clau!

183
00:14:43,927 --> 00:14:47,078
He's right. You'll be better off
in the Senate.

184
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:49,482
We'll move for a trial in the Senate.

185
00:14:52,087 --> 00:14:55,796
In the Senate?
What's wrong with the courts?

186
00:14:55,967 --> 00:15:00,040
I tried for the courts, but my son
and his friends pressed for the Senate.

187
00:15:00,207 --> 00:15:02,198
I had no grounds to oppose them.

188
00:15:02,367 --> 00:15:03,720
Well..

189
00:15:04,847 --> 00:15:07,156
If it's the Senate, it's the Senate.

190
00:15:07,327 --> 00:15:11,957
Why should I be concerned?
I'm no stranger to the Senate.

191
00:15:13,127 --> 00:15:17,643
If my enemies have friends there,
so have I. They’ll find that out.

192
00:15:18,767 --> 00:15:22,726
- And you will be hearing the case?
- Of course.

193
00:15:22,887 --> 00:15:26,596
Well. then, what better guarantee
of justice have we?

194
00:15:26,767 --> 00:15:30,123
And justice is all Plancina and I
came home for.

195
00:15:30,287 --> 00:15:32,596
We've done nothing
to be ashamed of -

196
00:15:32,767 --> 00:15:35,964
except that it makes me ashamed
to have to say so.

197
00:15:36,127 --> 00:15:39,597
That was very well put.
I couldn't have put that better.

198
00:15:39,767 --> 00:15:42,645
But that shame will be theirs
in the end.

199
00:15:42,807 --> 00:15:45,480
Certain people
will come to rue the day

200
00:15:45,647 --> 00:15:49,162
they accused Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso
and his wife of murder!

201
00:15:49,767 --> 00:15:52,486
They’re arraigning you
for treason as well

202
00:15:54,247 --> 00:15:55,566
Treason?

203
00:15:57,607 --> 00:16:00,405
Oh, it's treason now, is it?.

204
00:16:00,567 --> 00:16:02,922
What will they think of next?.

205
00:16:03,847 --> 00:16:06,077
That I caused a plague of moths?

206
00:16:08,327 --> 00:16:11,239
Or it is I who am polluting
the Tiber?.

207
00:16:11,407 --> 00:16:15,082
There was a drought in Syria
when I left, perhaps I caused that?.

208
00:16:15,247 --> 00:16:17,715
I should prepare your defence well

209
00:16:17,887 --> 00:16:22,642
I shall That will take me no time.
But treason! Where is the treason?

210
00:16:22,807 --> 00:16:26,925
I mean, I had certain disagreements
with Germanicus,

211
00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:28,998
but I wasn't his house boy.

212
00:16:29,167 --> 00:16:33,445
They were very cold to us, you know -
Germanicus and Agrippina.

213
00:16:33,607 --> 00:16:35,563
From the start, they snubbed us.

214
00:16:35,727 --> 00:16:37,957
Naturally.
They knew why I was there.

215
00:16:38,127 --> 00:16:43,281
I had not been made Governor
of Syria to follow like a small dog.

216
00:16:43,447 --> 00:16:46,883
I was there as watch dog
for my Emperor, and they knew it.

217
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:49,845
Oh, the insults
we bore at their hands!

218
00:16:50,007 --> 00:16:53,204
(PLANCINA) Members
of his own command were ashamed.

219
00:16:53,367 --> 00:16:57,519
At official banquets,
we were seated on the third couch,

220
00:16:57,687 --> 00:17:02,158
and Agrippina gave herself such airs,
she might have been queen!

221
00:17:03,167 --> 00:17:05,635
And they accuse me of treason.

222
00:17:06,407 --> 00:17:10,082
Oh, don't talk to me of treason.
Not to me.

223
00:17:10,247 --> 00:17:14,286
What has my whole life been but one
of service to Rome and my Emperor?.

224
00:17:14,447 --> 00:17:18,326
My sons, too. Let the jackals howl.
I have nothing to fear.

225
00:17:18,487 --> 00:17:21,604
My head is held high.
I'm ashamed of nothing...

226
00:17:21,767 --> 00:17:23,086
(KNOCKING)

227
00:17:23,247 --> 00:17:25,283
I gave orders not to be disturbed!

228
00:17:25,447 --> 00:17:29,565
My lord, the Commander of the Guard
has an urgent report to make.

229
00:17:32,567 --> 00:17:34,000
Wait here.

230
00:17:40,567 --> 00:17:43,764
He says very little.
He neither agrees nor disagrees.

231
00:17:43,927 --> 00:17:46,566
- He already plays the judge.
- The judge? How?.

232
00:17:46,727 --> 00:17:48,957
He listens, but not with sympathy.

233
00:17:49,127 --> 00:17:51,960
That's just his way.
He's a very cold fish.

234
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:54,277
It's not what I expected.

235
00:17:58,647 --> 00:18:01,844
Each one written
in his own handwriting.

236
00:18:02,007 --> 00:18:04,840
Quote: "I have
the utmost faith in you."

237
00:18:05,007 --> 00:18:07,567
Quote: "Any steps taken
to chock disloyalty

238
00:18:07,727 --> 00:18:10,560
"will be looked on kindly
by the Senate."

239
00:18:10,727 --> 00:18:14,276
What did he expect me to make
of such phrases? I'm not a fool

240
00:18:14,447 --> 00:18:17,962
- They are his tacit agreement.
- But they bear his seal

241
00:18:18,127 --> 00:18:22,678
No letter bearing the Imperial seal
can be read in public.

242
00:18:23,087 --> 00:18:25,442
I don't need it
to be read in public.

243
00:18:27,007 --> 00:18:30,522
They will be beside me in the Senate,
mute, but eloquent.

244
00:18:30,687 --> 00:18:33,281
They will plead our case
better than Cicero.

245
00:18:33,447 --> 00:18:36,598
Every Senator will understand
their meaning

246
00:18:36,767 --> 00:18:40,157
and vote the way he believes
his Emperor wants him to.

247
00:18:44,047 --> 00:18:46,003
Who is the woman, Martina?

248
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:49,080
Martina.

249
00:18:49,247 --> 00:18:53,763
The widow of the Roman who settled
in Antioch. We knew her slightly.

250
00:18:53,927 --> 00:18:57,078
Did you know she was notorious
as a poisoner?.

251
00:18:57,247 --> 00:19:00,796
Poisoner?. Has she ever
been convicted of poisoning?

252
00:19:00,967 --> 00:19:02,366
What of her?.

253
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:05,325
Sejanus says she is in Rome
to be a witness.

254
00:19:05,487 --> 00:19:07,443
Where is she?

255
00:19:07,607 --> 00:19:11,725
His agents haven't found her yet.
Do you have anything to fear from her?.

256
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,837
Not if she speaks the truth.

257
00:19:19,967 --> 00:19:22,401
But if she's held incommunicado,

258
00:19:22,567 --> 00:19:25,684
who knows what they might
persuade her to say?.

259
00:19:25,847 --> 00:19:28,407
Well. let's hope we find her first.

260
00:19:30,807 --> 00:19:34,243
I loved this room. It was my life.

261
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:36,841
But you won't mind letting it to us?

262
00:19:37,007 --> 00:19:41,205
- You've got to pay in advance.
- My friend will pay.

263
00:19:41,367 --> 00:19:44,564
- Are you taking the room?
- Y-yes.

264
00:19:44,727 --> 00:19:48,083
You'll like it.
It's got a fine view of the river.

265
00:19:48,247 --> 00:19:50,238
If you stand on the box, you'll see.

266
00:19:50,407 --> 00:19:54,161
It's n-n-not for me.
It's f-for my mother.

267
00:19:54,327 --> 00:19:58,366
Oh. Well. it's not very comfortable.

268
00:20:00,047 --> 00:20:03,517
What about those soldiers?
I'm not letting a barracks!

269
00:20:03,687 --> 00:20:06,645
No questions, Gershon.
She's being locked up.

270
00:20:06,807 --> 00:20:11,722
Locked up?! What kind of a son are you?
"Honour thy father and mother!"

271
00:20:11,887 --> 00:20:14,799
- Do you want us to look elsewhere?
- Of course!

272
00:20:14,967 --> 00:20:17,561
What do you think I run here?
A jail?.

273
00:20:22,367 --> 00:20:24,642
Is t-t-that enough?

274
00:20:25,207 --> 00:20:28,643
If I approved of what you were doing,
it would be enough,

275
00:20:28,807 --> 00:20:32,004
but since you're offending
against Mosaic law...

276
00:20:33,367 --> 00:20:35,278
It's Roman law here, Gershon.

277
00:20:35,447 --> 00:20:39,440
It's Roman law everywhere.
That's the trouble. But one day...

278
00:20:42,807 --> 00:20:46,516
With that son, you've got
to be lucky with your daughters.

279
00:20:49,967 --> 00:20:53,164
Like everyone else,
I grieve for Germanicus.

280
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:56,766
But apart from the charge of murder,

281
00:20:56,927 --> 00:21:00,476
we must consider
the question of treason.

282
00:21:01,167 --> 00:21:07,117
Did Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso incite
his troops to mutiny and rebellion?

283
00:21:08,127 --> 00:21:10,880
Did he bribe them to support him?

284
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:14,958
Did he make war
to regain his province?

285
00:21:16,527 --> 00:21:22,841
The case against Gnaeus Calpurnius
Piso may now be heard.

286
00:21:26,247 --> 00:21:28,238
If it please the Emperor, my father,

287
00:21:28,407 --> 00:21:31,797
I have been asked to open the case
against the accused.

288
00:21:32,327 --> 00:21:34,761
In the matter of murder,

289
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:39,284
we shall be bringing before the House
clear evidence of poisoning.

290
00:21:39,727 --> 00:21:44,198
In the matter of treason, we shall
show that after Germanicus' death,

291
00:21:44,367 --> 00:21:48,406
Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso raised
the troops in a rebellion

292
00:21:48,567 --> 00:21:51,479
against the new governor
of that province.

293
00:21:51,647 --> 00:21:54,719
Let go of me,
you horrible German woman!

294
00:21:58,007 --> 00:21:59,998
- What's this?
- I hate you!

295
00:22:00,167 --> 00:22:03,921
- What's the matter?.
- He is disgusting!

296
00:22:04,087 --> 00:22:05,839
- What has he done?
- Oh!

297
00:22:06,007 --> 00:22:09,363
- What has he done?
- That child is a monster!

298
00:22:09,527 --> 00:22:12,599
I'm not! You horrid German!
I'll burn your house down!

299
00:22:12,767 --> 00:22:17,477
Stop it! Stop it! Come here!
Now, what is all this G-German?

300
00:22:17,647 --> 00:22:19,638
It's German if he doesn't like it.

301
00:22:19,807 --> 00:22:22,241
- What has he done?
- He knows!

302
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:24,523
I didn't do anything! I didn't!

303
00:22:24,687 --> 00:22:28,475
Honestly, Uncle Claudius. I didn't
do anything. It was a game.

304
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:32,083
I found him in Drusilla's bed.
Naked, the pair of them!

305
00:22:32,247 --> 00:22:35,603
They’re revolting.
I've locked her in her room!

306
00:22:35,767 --> 00:22:38,406
- Mother...
- You're a blockhead to believe him!

307
00:22:38,567 --> 00:22:40,683
- Where are you taking him?
- The cellar.

308
00:22:40,847 --> 00:22:44,317
Please don't let her take me.
I'm afraid of the cellar.

309
00:22:44,487 --> 00:22:47,718
You leave him with me.
I'll t-t-talk to him.

310
00:22:47,887 --> 00:22:50,640
He needs a good whipping,
not a talking to!

311
00:22:50,807 --> 00:22:54,322
Claudius, you're such a fool!
I've no patience with you.

312
00:22:54,487 --> 00:22:58,560
It should have been you who died,
not Germanicus! What use are you?

313
00:23:07,527 --> 00:23:09,882
Now, don't you know

314
00:23:10,047 --> 00:23:14,165
that you sh-shouldn't play games
like that with your sister?.

315
00:23:14,327 --> 00:23:17,205
Eh? Don't you know
how w=wicked it is?

316
00:23:17,887 --> 00:23:20,037
- Why?.
- Why?.

317
00:23:21,247 --> 00:23:24,319
- B-because it is.
- Why?.

318
00:23:24,487 --> 00:23:27,320
Don't answer me back
or I'll clout you round the head!

319
00:23:27,487 --> 00:23:29,717
Now, you listen to me.

320
00:23:30,647 --> 00:23:36,244
Now, a sister is a sister
and she's not to be p-p-played with -

321
00:23:36,407 --> 00:23:38,762
ever, do you understand?

322
00:23:38,927 --> 00:23:43,796
You can't p-p-play with her
and you can't m-marry her.

323
00:23:44,607 --> 00:23:48,361
- But she wanted to...
- I don't care what she wanted!

324
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:53,726
You're disgusting, the pair of you.
I shall talk to Dr-Drusilla later.

325
00:23:55,847 --> 00:23:58,600
- What's the matter?.
- Martina's disappeared.

326
00:23:58,767 --> 00:24:01,486
- What?. !
- We went to fetch her. She was gone.

327
00:24:01,647 --> 00:24:04,036
The guard outside
had been overpowered.

328
00:24:04,207 --> 00:24:06,198
- Oh, Sejanus?
- Who else?

329
00:24:07,007 --> 00:24:09,077
That man's spies are everywhere!

330
00:24:10,087 --> 00:24:12,078
Thick as flies in summer!

331
00:24:12,247 --> 00:24:14,203
We've lost our chief witness, then?

332
00:24:14,367 --> 00:24:17,996
That won't save the pair of them.
What's he doing here?

333
00:24:18,167 --> 00:24:21,876
He's been v-very naughty.
Mother was going to thrash him.

334
00:24:22,047 --> 00:24:26,165
Can't people leave him alone?
Hasn't he been through enough?

335
00:24:27,527 --> 00:24:30,963
When I heard of the death
of Germanicus,

336
00:24:31,127 --> 00:24:33,163
I was on the island of Cos.

337
00:24:33,327 --> 00:24:39,596
In fact on my way back to Rome
to report my dismissal to the Emperor.

338
00:24:39,767 --> 00:24:44,238
Yes, and complain about it.
I make no bones about that.

339
00:24:45,727 --> 00:24:49,197
Now, my accusers say
that I entered temples

340
00:24:49,367 --> 00:24:53,042
and made sacrifices
in an orgy of celebration.

341
00:24:53,207 --> 00:24:55,277
(SHOUTING) So you did!

342
00:24:55,447 --> 00:24:57,677
One ewe and a goat!

343
00:24:57,847 --> 00:25:03,205
What orgy. And why?. To celebrate
the birth of a grandson.

344
00:25:03,367 --> 00:25:06,040
To celebrate
the death of Germanicus!

345
00:25:06,207 --> 00:25:09,882
The living have rights!
You would have done the same.

346
00:25:10,047 --> 00:25:13,403
Why did you return to Syria?
Why didn't you go to Rome?

347
00:25:13,567 --> 00:25:15,637
I was still Governor of Syria.

348
00:25:15,807 --> 00:25:17,240
(ANGRY SHOUTING)

349
00:25:17,407 --> 00:25:21,195
We have the written instructions
of Germanicus,

350
00:25:21,367 --> 00:25:23,403
ordering you to leave the province.

351
00:25:23,567 --> 00:25:25,523
Surtius was Governor of Syria.

352
00:25:25,687 --> 00:25:27,996
Illegally!
That governorship was mine!

353
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:32,806
The man who had unfairly removed me
was dead.

354
00:25:32,967 --> 00:25:39,520
I had my appointment.
I had my instructions.

355
00:25:41,167 --> 00:25:43,203
I knew where my loyalties lay.

356
00:25:43,367 --> 00:25:45,927
- Read them out!
- Read the letters!

357
00:25:49,287 --> 00:25:51,926
I have no need to read them!

358
00:25:52,527 --> 00:25:55,166
My defence will stand
on its own merit.

359
00:25:55,327 --> 00:25:58,046
(ANGRY SHOUTING)

360
00:25:59,207 --> 00:26:01,084
I said I have no need to read...

361
00:26:01,247 --> 00:26:06,844
Unless order is maintained
in the House, I shall adjourn!

362
00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:14,725
If Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso's argument
is to rely upon instructions,

363
00:26:14,887 --> 00:26:17,685
this House has the right
to know what's in them.

364
00:26:17,847 --> 00:26:19,963
(SHOUTS OF AGREEMENT)

365
00:26:21,967 --> 00:26:25,004
These letters
bear the Imperial seal

366
00:26:25,847 --> 00:26:27,963
No one has the right to read them.

367
00:26:31,567 --> 00:26:35,116
The Emperor may consent
to having them read.

368
00:26:35,287 --> 00:26:38,359
- They have no bearing on the case.
- Why produce them?

369
00:26:38,527 --> 00:26:41,997
They’re not evidence.
They are here among my papers.

370
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:44,317
(SHOUTING AGAIN)

371
00:26:46,607 --> 00:26:48,563
If it please the Emperor,

372
00:26:48,727 --> 00:26:52,800
I move that any instructions
received by the accused from Rome

373
00:26:52,967 --> 00:26:55,845
be entered as evidence
of his guilt or innocence.

374
00:26:56,007 --> 00:26:57,918
I second that motion.

375
00:27:03,247 --> 00:27:05,761
Those letters
bear the Imperial seal

376
00:27:06,407 --> 00:27:08,796
The seal of the god Augustus
himself.

377
00:27:09,607 --> 00:27:13,122
There is no precedence
for making their contents public.

378
00:27:13,287 --> 00:27:15,437
I will not create such a precedent.

379
00:27:16,367 --> 00:27:18,358
The motion is denied.

380
00:27:18,527 --> 00:27:20,404
(ANGRY SHOUTING)

381
00:27:23,047 --> 00:27:26,005
They got more
than they bargained for!

382
00:27:26,167 --> 00:27:31,446
They thought they had a rabbit
in the Senate, but they had a tiger. Eh, Plancina?

383
00:27:32,687 --> 00:27:35,565
Oh, leave us, my friends.
Plancina's tired.

384
00:27:35,727 --> 00:27:39,879
A good night's rest and a little
peace and quiet will work miracles.

385
00:27:40,327 --> 00:27:44,320
Our enterprise will prosper again
tomorrow. Goodnight, my friends.

386
00:27:57,447 --> 00:27:59,597
What's the matter, Plancina?

387
00:27:59,767 --> 00:28:03,282
I don't like it.
It didn't go the way it should.

388
00:28:04,607 --> 00:28:06,598
I thought it went very well

389
00:28:06,767 --> 00:28:09,884
- Using those letters was a mistake.
- Mistake?

390
00:28:10,047 --> 00:28:12,686
You saw his face.
He'll never forgive you.

391
00:28:12,847 --> 00:28:14,838
We were carrying out his orders.

392
00:28:15,007 --> 00:28:17,202
He won't thank you
for reminding him.

393
00:28:17,367 --> 00:28:20,359
I don't want his thanks,
as long as he remembers.

394
00:28:20,527 --> 00:28:22,722
He'll never forgive you, never.

395
00:28:22,887 --> 00:28:27,199
He should ask my forgiveness.
That trial should never have taken place.

396
00:28:27,367 --> 00:28:29,403
Then why has he allowed it?. !

397
00:28:32,767 --> 00:28:34,883
He had to give them a show.

398
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:40,201
Germanicus has powerful friends.
He can't just thumb his nose at them.

399
00:28:41,527 --> 00:28:43,836
So he gives them a trial

400
00:28:44,807 --> 00:28:47,526
A trial is one thing,
a conviction is another.

401
00:28:47,687 --> 00:28:50,759
Because if we're guilty,
so is he and so is his mother.

402
00:28:50,927 --> 00:28:52,918
He knows that and the Senate does.

403
00:28:53,087 --> 00:28:57,080
We did what we were asked -
provoke Germanicus into showing his hand.

404
00:28:57,247 --> 00:28:59,715
Did that include
bringing about his death?

405
00:28:59,887 --> 00:29:01,923
Yes. Well. that was your idea.

406
00:29:03,727 --> 00:29:06,036
- My idea?
- Yes.

407
00:29:07,367 --> 00:29:09,437
What does it matter?.

408
00:29:09,607 --> 00:29:12,724
It's a bonus for them.
They’re not complaining.

409
00:29:12,887 --> 00:29:15,117
What do you mean, it was my idea?

410
00:29:15,287 --> 00:29:17,676
You came to me
and said it could be managed.

411
00:29:17,847 --> 00:29:20,566
Well. that's wonderful!

412
00:29:21,207 --> 00:29:23,801
- I'm to blame then, am I?
- Of course not.

413
00:29:23,967 --> 00:29:28,006
I can see the way your mind is
working. I'm going to be sacrificed.

414
00:29:28,167 --> 00:29:30,556
- What?.
- Sacrificed at the temple!

415
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:33,446
- Well. I won't be! I won't be!
- Stop it!

416
00:29:33,607 --> 00:29:37,725
- Yes, what is it?.
- Lucius Aelius Sejanus is here.

417
00:29:39,607 --> 00:29:42,485
- Show him in.
- What does he want?.

418
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:46,196
How would I know?.
For heaven's sake, control yourself.

419
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:49,484
I don't want him
to see you looking like this.

420
00:29:58,407 --> 00:30:02,366
I came to tell you, sir, that I've
had guards placed round the house.

421
00:30:03,447 --> 00:30:07,076
Why?. I have guards of my own.

422
00:30:07,247 --> 00:30:10,683
Of course. But the crowd is large
and in an ugly mood.

423
00:30:10,847 --> 00:30:14,920
What's their mood to me? I go where
I please in Rome. Nobody stops me.

424
00:30:15,087 --> 00:30:18,204
The Emperor requested it.
For your safety.

425
00:30:21,087 --> 00:30:25,638
Well. if it's for our safety,
we're very pleased, eh, Plancina?

426
00:30:27,847 --> 00:30:32,204
I understand their chief witness
against me has disappeared.

427
00:30:32,367 --> 00:30:34,005
So it seems.

428
00:30:34,167 --> 00:30:36,681
Perhaps they never had one at all

429
00:30:36,847 --> 00:30:41,967
Oh, I think they had one, but,
unaccountably, she's disappeared.

430
00:30:44,567 --> 00:30:50,119
Oh, by the way, the Emperor asked me
to ask you for the letters.

431
00:30:53,887 --> 00:30:55,240
The letters?

432
00:30:55,407 --> 00:30:58,444
As state documents,
they should be in the archives.

433
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:02,520
After all. they might get stolen
or fall into the wrong hands.

434
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:13,638
As a matter of fact I was
just about to send them round.

435
00:31:13,807 --> 00:31:16,116
We were just talking about it.

436
00:31:33,847 --> 00:31:38,045
Here they are.
Give them to the Emperor.

437
00:31:38,207 --> 00:31:41,643
Tell him I will never forget
the things he wrote.

438
00:31:45,407 --> 00:31:48,843
- I treasure in my mind every word.
- Thank you.

439
00:31:50,087 --> 00:31:53,204
The Imperial Guard will escort you
to the Senate.

440
00:31:53,367 --> 00:31:55,483
You needn't worry about the crowds.

441
00:32:01,207 --> 00:32:05,564
Tell the Emperor I am grateful
Tell him I'm always of service.

442
00:32:06,447 --> 00:32:11,202
Tell him Calpurnius Piso is his
humble servant and always will be!

443
00:32:11,767 --> 00:32:13,678
You'll have to sacrifice them.

444
00:32:13,847 --> 00:32:16,202
The mob will not have them
acquitted.

445
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:20,042
They’re dragging Piso's statues
to the Tiber and smashing them.

446
00:32:20,207 --> 00:32:23,199
They already have the meat hooks
under his chin.

447
00:32:23,367 --> 00:32:25,244
What are they saying about me?

448
00:32:25,407 --> 00:32:28,205
That Piso and his wife
had your approval

449
00:32:28,367 --> 00:32:31,165
If you let them go,
they’ll be convinced of it.

450
00:32:31,327 --> 00:32:34,478
But, above all.
they praise Agrippina.

451
00:32:34,647 --> 00:32:36,842
The glory of her country,
they call her,

452
00:32:37,007 --> 00:32:39,362
the only true descendant
of Augustus.

453
00:32:40,487 --> 00:32:44,196
- Did he give you the letters?
- He expects you to save him,

454
00:32:44,367 --> 00:32:46,517
but you must not.

455
00:32:53,327 --> 00:32:56,524
I have come to tell you, Tiberius,
that I and all of Rome,

456
00:32:56,687 --> 00:33:01,124
blame you for my husband's death
until you can prove your innocence.

457
00:33:01,287 --> 00:33:05,121
We know you've taken our witness,
but it will avail you nothing.

458
00:33:05,287 --> 00:33:08,757
Emperor you may be,
but justice is emperor over all

459
00:33:08,927 --> 00:33:12,602
The fact you are not queen -
is that the greatest injustice?

460
00:33:12,767 --> 00:33:17,124
Vengeance, Tiberius! The people are
crying for it on every corner.

461
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:20,040
Rome will not rest
until you give it to them.

462
00:33:20,807 --> 00:33:22,684
And neither shall I.

463
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:34,642
- Where is the woman, Martina?
- We don't know.

464
00:33:36,087 --> 00:33:38,078
Then find her.

465
00:33:42,287 --> 00:33:44,278
Am I to be blamed for everything?

466
00:33:44,447 --> 00:33:49,123
How will you get a conviction
if you don't find her?. Find her!

467
00:33:51,807 --> 00:33:55,436
What other poisons do you use?
Have you tried aconite?

468
00:33:55,607 --> 00:33:57,643
Aconite? What's that?.

469
00:33:57,807 --> 00:34:01,436
Well. the roots look
very like horseradish,

470
00:34:01,607 --> 00:34:04,326
but it'll do more
than clear your head.

471
00:34:05,167 --> 00:34:08,443
Oh, yes, bless you, Lady.
I know the one you mean.

472
00:34:08,607 --> 00:34:13,158
You mean wolf's bane. That's what
we call it. It came from India.

473
00:34:13,327 --> 00:34:15,318
Really?. I never knew that.

474
00:34:15,487 --> 00:34:17,682
I boot you didn't know its antidote.

475
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:19,280
Morphine?

476
00:34:20,247 --> 00:34:25,321
You have made a study of it. I don't
worry too much about antidotes.

477
00:34:25,487 --> 00:34:30,083
Well. you never know. Some fool of a slave
might get the bowls mixed up.

478
00:34:30,247 --> 00:34:32,522
I can see you've read a lot.

479
00:34:33,447 --> 00:34:38,157
It's a pity you don't get a chance
to practise. You'd be very good.

480
00:34:39,247 --> 00:34:40,566
Thank you.

481
00:34:40,727 --> 00:34:45,403
Tell me, what did you use
on my grandson, Germanicus?

482
00:34:45,567 --> 00:34:47,797
Ah, belladonna.

483
00:34:47,967 --> 00:34:50,117
Ah, that accounts for the red rash.

484
00:34:50,287 --> 00:34:54,917
It always leaves that mark. I didn't
want it, but Plancina insisted.

485
00:34:55,087 --> 00:35:00,320
I warned her, but she'd been told
by know-it-alls how tasteless it was.

486
00:35:00,487 --> 00:35:02,364
You know what people are like.

487
00:35:02,527 --> 00:35:06,486
Amateurs. But you used witchcraft
as well

488
00:35:07,167 --> 00:35:09,158
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

489
00:35:10,327 --> 00:35:13,046
All I did was arrange
some apparitions.

490
00:35:13,207 --> 00:35:16,802
Your grandson was more superstitious
than any man living.

491
00:35:16,967 --> 00:35:19,003
I frightened him to death.

492
00:35:19,167 --> 00:35:23,638
If a man believes he's going to die,
he'll die a lot quicker.

493
00:35:25,767 --> 00:35:28,281
How did you gain access
to that house?

494
00:35:29,567 --> 00:35:32,081
You remember when Germanicus
went to Egypt,

495
00:35:32,247 --> 00:35:36,160
he took Agrippina, but he left
Caligula behind as a punishment.

496
00:35:36,327 --> 00:35:39,205
- What for?.
- He was never out of mischief.

497
00:35:39,367 --> 00:35:42,757
He hated his father.
They fought like cat and dog.

498
00:35:42,927 --> 00:35:45,839
He told me how superstitious
his father was.

499
00:35:46,007 --> 00:35:51,445
Well. they left him in the care
of a tutor - a Greek, whom I knew.

500
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:56,522
He took the child for walks in the city,
and he brought him to see me.

501
00:35:57,247 --> 00:35:59,841
Oh, that child's a strange one.

502
00:36:00,607 --> 00:36:03,565
He told me once he was born a god,

503
00:36:03,727 --> 00:36:07,163
and such was the conviction with
which he said it, I believed him,

504
00:36:07,327 --> 00:36:09,079
and I said I did.

505
00:36:09,247 --> 00:36:12,922
It was then I suggested
that he played the death game.

506
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:17,126
I said, "A god should be able
to frighten a man to death."

507
00:36:17,287 --> 00:36:21,280
And he shouted, "Tell me how
and I'll show you." So I told him.

508
00:36:21,447 --> 00:36:26,965
Are you telling me that
that child poisoned his own father?.

509
00:36:28,047 --> 00:36:31,835
- Shocking, isn't it?.
- He's not a god, he's a monster.

510
00:36:32,007 --> 00:36:34,077
You try telling him.

511
00:36:37,207 --> 00:36:39,801
- What's the matter?.
- I don't know...

512
00:36:40,927 --> 00:36:42,883
I've got a pain.

513
00:36:50,287 --> 00:36:55,884
Oh, come, it's wind. That's all
I have it all the time.

514
00:36:56,887 --> 00:37:01,358
If I wanted to dispose of you,
do you think I'd do it myself?.

515
00:37:02,727 --> 00:37:07,596
What...?
What's going to happen to me?

516
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:11,282
I don't know.
I'll do the best I can for you.

517
00:37:12,127 --> 00:37:15,915
It's lucky for you that my agents
found you before my son's did.

518
00:37:16,087 --> 00:37:19,204
You wouldn't be sitting here
complaining about wind.

519
00:37:24,967 --> 00:37:29,677
The trial of Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso
and his wife Plancina is resumed.

520
00:37:30,287 --> 00:37:34,326
We understand that the principal
witness in the charge of poisoning

521
00:37:34,487 --> 00:37:36,284
has not been found.

522
00:37:36,447 --> 00:37:39,280
In her absence,
the prosecution have no case,

523
00:37:39,447 --> 00:37:42,883
and we request
that the charge be withdrawn.

524
00:37:43,047 --> 00:37:45,641
(ROWDY OUTCRY)

525
00:37:48,647 --> 00:37:50,603
Request denied.

526
00:37:50,767 --> 00:37:52,598
(CHEERING)

527
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:58,925
If it please the Emperor, the wife
of Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso

528
00:37:59,087 --> 00:38:03,603
has asked that her defence be
conducted separately

529
00:38:03,767 --> 00:38:05,325
from her husband's,

530
00:38:05,487 --> 00:38:08,797
and that she be tried
independently from him.

531
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:15,035
Why...?!
Why did you do this to me?

532
00:38:17,087 --> 00:38:19,078
Don't you see what they think?

533
00:38:20,407 --> 00:38:22,398
Do you want me to die?!

534
00:38:22,567 --> 00:38:25,286
They’ve made up their minds.

535
00:38:25,447 --> 00:38:29,201
There's nothing you nor I can say
will change them.

536
00:38:31,327 --> 00:38:36,003
The Emperor has abandoned you.
He's given you up to the mob.

537
00:38:37,887 --> 00:38:41,846
There's nothing on earth
can save you now.

538
00:38:46,287 --> 00:38:47,959
What about you?

539
00:38:50,647 --> 00:38:55,562
I'll go to Livia. She, at least,
stands by her friends.

540
00:39:11,447 --> 00:39:14,166
Oh, Piso, listen to me.

541
00:39:15,087 --> 00:39:19,285
There's the honour and wealth
of our family to be saved.

542
00:39:19,447 --> 00:39:24,043
Our sons, our daughters,
our grandchildren - what of them?

543
00:39:28,687 --> 00:39:30,200
If...

544
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:33,636
If you would take your life now...

545
00:39:37,847 --> 00:39:40,645
If you take your life,
there's a chance...

546
00:39:41,847 --> 00:39:46,637
a good one, that an honourable death
will preserve the family wealth.

547
00:39:47,567 --> 00:39:53,836
Execution means only one thing -
destruction for all we've built.

548
00:40:00,887 --> 00:40:02,878
Fall on a sword?

549
00:40:04,687 --> 00:40:07,884
Is that what you want for me,
your husband?

550
00:40:10,927 --> 00:40:14,044
Is that to be the end
for Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso?

551
00:40:18,367 --> 00:40:19,959
No.

552
00:40:21,567 --> 00:40:24,639
There is another way.
You go to Livia, yes!

553
00:40:25,807 --> 00:40:30,722
Tell her I have another letter.
She'll remember the one she wrote.

554
00:40:31,207 --> 00:40:36,076
It's in her name and his,
but it bears no seal

555
00:40:37,487 --> 00:40:41,639
Tell her no power on earth will
prevent me reading it aloud tomorrow

556
00:40:41,807 --> 00:40:44,367
unless I have assurances
of acquittal

557
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,483
You're bluffing.

558
00:40:52,767 --> 00:40:54,200
No.

559
00:40:56,447 --> 00:40:58,244
Tell her.

560
00:41:00,447 --> 00:41:02,119
She'll remember.

561
00:41:02,887 --> 00:41:06,675
Tell her I intend to read it aloud
in the Senate tomorrow.

562
00:41:09,327 --> 00:41:11,966
Don't look at me as if
I'd told you I was pregnant!

563
00:41:12,687 --> 00:41:15,645
He's got a letter,
and it's very incriminating.

564
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:19,004
He'll read it
unless we do something about it.

565
00:41:22,287 --> 00:41:27,839
You wrote a letter in my name
and yours without even using the seal?.

566
00:41:29,127 --> 00:41:32,437
You were away, and anyway
you don't let me use the seal

567
00:41:32,607 --> 00:41:34,882
Who's Emperor here, you or I?

568
00:41:35,047 --> 00:41:38,483
I used Augustus' seal
I had the free use of that.

569
00:41:38,647 --> 00:41:40,478
I am not Augustus!

570
00:41:40,647 --> 00:41:44,640
No, you're not. Otherwise this
situation would never have arisen.

571
00:41:44,807 --> 00:41:46,843
I think I shall go mad.

572
00:41:47,007 --> 00:41:49,441
You will drive me insane!

573
00:41:50,327 --> 00:41:52,841
Will you stay out of my affairs?!

574
00:41:53,007 --> 00:41:56,841
Your affairs? You wouldn't be
Emperor if it weren't for me.

575
00:41:57,007 --> 00:42:01,558
What's done can be undone.
Plancina isn't the only one with letters.

576
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:05,402
I've got plenty from Augustus
saying what he thought about you,

577
00:42:05,567 --> 00:42:08,206
and don't think I won't
have them circulated.

578
00:42:09,407 --> 00:42:11,284
What do you want?.

579
00:42:12,567 --> 00:42:15,525
I don't want that letter
read in the Senate.

580
00:42:15,687 --> 00:42:18,281
You'd be a fool if you allowed it.

581
00:42:19,447 --> 00:42:22,007
You want my assurances
that they’ll be acquitted?

582
00:42:22,167 --> 00:42:24,556
Of course I do.
They should be acquitted.

583
00:42:24,727 --> 00:42:27,161
If you had any backbone,
you'd do it.

584
00:42:27,887 --> 00:42:29,878
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.

585
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:33,437
It's your letter, you stick to it...

586
00:42:34,407 --> 00:42:37,956
and if it's read in the House,
I'll deny all knowledge of it

587
00:42:38,127 --> 00:42:41,722
and excuse you on the grounds
of mental incompetence

588
00:42:41,887 --> 00:42:46,278
brought on by extreme old age.

589
00:42:46,447 --> 00:42:51,441
And you can tell your friend
Plancina that there will be no deal!

590
00:42:53,327 --> 00:42:57,639
What a spineless, miserable,

591
00:42:57,807 --> 00:43:01,800
mean-spirited creature you are!

592
00:43:06,607 --> 00:43:08,598
He won't have it.

593
00:43:11,527 --> 00:43:13,802
He won't acquit your husband.

594
00:43:14,647 --> 00:43:17,036
There is too much feeling
against him.

595
00:43:17,207 --> 00:43:19,198
And what about me?

596
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:24,557
Well. I was a little
more successful there.

597
00:43:26,167 --> 00:43:28,317
In exchange for the letter,

598
00:43:28,487 --> 00:43:32,321
he will allow your husband
to take his own life

599
00:43:32,487 --> 00:43:34,478
rather than face execution.

600
00:43:34,647 --> 00:43:37,684
Then he will see to it
that you are spared

601
00:43:37,847 --> 00:43:41,157
and that your family
and your estates do not suffer.

602
00:43:42,007 --> 00:43:44,965
And if my husband refuses?

603
00:43:45,167 --> 00:43:48,842
I would see to it that he doesn't
refuse if I were you.

604
00:43:49,007 --> 00:43:53,159
It shouldn't be hard. Appeal to his
honour. Men find that irresistible.

605
00:43:53,327 --> 00:43:58,162
But what guarantee do I have
that your son will get me acquitted?

606
00:43:58,327 --> 00:44:02,798
Well. you see, I have Martina.

607
00:44:04,007 --> 00:44:05,963
But he doesn't know that.

608
00:44:06,127 --> 00:44:10,484
Now, his chances of convicting you
without her are remote.

609
00:44:12,487 --> 00:44:14,398
On the other hand...

610
00:44:15,327 --> 00:44:17,477
if that letter is read,

611
00:44:17,647 --> 00:44:21,879
I shall be compelled -
very reluctantly...

612
00:44:23,207 --> 00:44:25,084
to produce her.

613
00:44:34,607 --> 00:44:38,725
He won't help us.
He has abandoned us.

614
00:44:44,167 --> 00:44:47,398
Oh, that miserable cur!

615
00:44:49,447 --> 00:44:53,645
I shall read this. The Senate will see
what sort of Emperor they have

616
00:44:53,807 --> 00:44:57,641
and what sort of bitch calls herself
"Mother of the nation"!

617
00:44:57,807 --> 00:45:02,517
No, wait. Piso, listen. We can't
fight them. They’re too powerful

618
00:45:02,687 --> 00:45:06,646
And, anyway, there's the children
and the estates.

619
00:45:07,487 --> 00:45:11,275
Is the whole family to be destroyed
because of us?

620
00:45:12,487 --> 00:45:17,880
Oh, I can't believe it.
It's not right. I won't allow it.

621
00:45:21,007 --> 00:45:23,043
We've lived together...

622
00:45:24,247 --> 00:45:26,283
we'll die together too.

623
00:45:28,607 --> 00:45:31,075
There's comfort in that,
isn't there?

624
00:45:35,567 --> 00:45:39,924
You would...die with me?

625
00:45:42,007 --> 00:45:44,885
Well. I couldn't live without you.

626
00:45:57,287 --> 00:46:00,324
We'll leave the letter for Livia.

627
00:46:01,447 --> 00:46:04,883
She'll help the family
when we've gone. I know that.

628
00:46:09,047 --> 00:46:10,958
Yes, you're right.

629
00:46:12,887 --> 00:46:14,923
I'm tired of it all

630
00:46:17,407 --> 00:46:22,720
To have everybody against you
when all you've done is your duty.

631
00:46:28,647 --> 00:46:31,878
There's no gratitude any more.

632
00:46:34,367 --> 00:46:37,165
No... No honour.

633
00:46:44,687 --> 00:46:49,238
To hell with Rome,
I've done with it.

634
00:47:04,607 --> 00:47:06,996
How shall we do it?. Open a vein?

635
00:47:07,167 --> 00:47:09,840
Let them find us lying together?.

636
00:47:14,207 --> 00:47:16,675
Shall we let them find us
lying together?.

637
00:47:48,247 --> 00:47:52,126
No, they’re bluffing. They wouldn't
dare have that letter read!

638
00:47:52,287 --> 00:47:55,916
Would you rather have
an executioner's sword?

639
00:47:56,087 --> 00:47:57,998
It'll never come to that!

640
00:47:58,167 --> 00:48:01,284
Oh, you coward!

641
00:48:02,727 --> 00:48:06,083
- Well. I'm made of sterner stuff.
- Plancina.

642
00:48:06,247 --> 00:48:08,966
I'll show you
how a Roman should die.

643
00:48:09,127 --> 00:48:13,325
Plancina, they’re bluffing.
They’ll never have that letter read...

644
00:49:00,287 --> 00:49:04,917
Yes. Piso is dead,
but Plancina goes free.

645
00:49:05,087 --> 00:49:07,078
And you call that justice?

646
00:49:07,247 --> 00:49:12,116
Well. it's s-s-some justice,
I suppose. Better than none.

647
00:49:12,287 --> 00:49:16,326
- Oh, yes. Some justice!
- Pina, can't we let it rest?.

648
00:49:16,487 --> 00:49:18,398
I have sons to think about.

649
00:49:18,567 --> 00:49:21,525
Their father is dead
because Tiberius hated him.

650
00:49:22,807 --> 00:49:24,638
Let's not deceive ourselves.

651
00:49:24,807 --> 00:49:27,879
If he hated their father,
will he love them?

652
00:49:28,687 --> 00:49:33,636
I worry about my boys -
Nero, Drusus,

653
00:49:33,807 --> 00:49:37,846
and dear little Caligula asleep in his bed.
What's to become of them?

654
00:49:38,007 --> 00:49:39,884
It's Sejanus.

655
00:49:40,047 --> 00:49:43,403
My father listens to him
and Sejanus plays on his fears.

656
00:49:44,727 --> 00:49:46,763
Can anyone smell burning?

657
00:49:47,647 --> 00:49:51,526
I can smell s-s-something.

658
00:49:51,687 --> 00:49:56,078
Mistress! Mistress!
Caligula's set fire to the house!

659
00:49:56,247 --> 00:49:59,319
It's burning. The whole
top floor is ablaze! Run!
