00:01:09,407 --> 00:01:13,116

00:01:13,287 --> 00:01:15,721
"treads summer bound to die..."

3
00:01:15,887 --> 00:01:19,926
(CLAUDIUS) Myself when young -
not a pretty sight

4
00:01:21,567 --> 00:01:27,199
"Then back to wintertime again
where nothing stirs.

5
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:31,157
"But, oh, what’re
the sky-led seasons mar,

6
00:01:31,327 --> 00:01:33,841
"Moon upon moon rebuilds it
with her..."

7
00:01:34,007 --> 00:01:38,797
Postumus, Agrippa's sole surviving son,
and my best friend.

8
00:01:39,207 --> 00:01:42,279
His mother, Julia was banished
you may remember,

9
00:01:42,447 --> 00:01:45,723
and his two elder brothers
died mysteriously.

10
00:01:46,167 --> 00:01:51,480
"..If the gods in heaven should add
the morrow to the day..."

11
00:01:52,407 --> 00:01:56,116
The golden-haired Apollo
is Germanicus my brother -

12
00:01:56,287 --> 00:01:58,278
already a great soldier.

13
00:01:59,287 --> 00:02:01,482
"..will ever hold.

00:02:02,647 --> 00:02:06,686
"When thou descendent once

"the stern assize..."

16
00:02:08,727 --> 00:02:13,278
And if you wait a moment, you will
see a creature of a different kind -

17
00:02:13,447 --> 00:02:15,597
Livilla my sister.

18
00:02:15,767 --> 00:02:20,602
Yes there she is tormenting
Postumus as usual

19
00:02:20,767 --> 00:02:23,201
when her husband is away.

20
00:02:24,807 --> 00:02:28,686
"..Shall friend thee more."

21
00:02:33,127 --> 00:02:36,597
Oh, beautiful. beautiful

22
00:02:36,767 --> 00:02:41,238
Horace, my dear fellow,
such language. Wonderful. wonderful

23
00:02:41,407 --> 00:02:43,716
Weren't they lovely poems?

24
00:02:43,887 --> 00:02:47,197
Exquisite.
Now, that's what I call poetry.

25
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:50,200
Ovid! No comparison.
It's better than Ovid.

26
00:02:50,367 --> 00:02:53,325
I don't care what they say!
I've never liked that man.

27
00:02:53,487 --> 00:02:56,877
His poetry's very beautiful.
but it's also very smutty.

28
00:02:57,047 --> 00:02:59,038
A lot of it's downright indecent.

29
00:02:59,207 --> 00:03:01,880
I wouldn't have him in the house.
Thank you.

30
00:03:02,047 --> 00:03:05,801
People say that he has a lovely voice,
but what does he do with it?.

31
00:03:05,967 --> 00:03:08,197
Talks a lot of smut, that's what!

32
00:03:13,487 --> 00:03:17,162
Write poetry, yes,
but write about nice things -

33
00:03:17,327 --> 00:03:19,682
things you'd like your children to hear.

34
00:03:19,847 --> 00:03:22,407
I want a copy of the book
when you publish.

35
00:03:22,567 --> 00:03:25,639
- Of course, Caesar.
- I've got a present for you.

36
00:03:25,807 --> 00:03:28,560
- But Caesar...
- It's a little gold statue.

37
00:03:28,727 --> 00:03:33,164
Etruscan, I think. It's solid gold,
but you'll appreciate it properly.

38
00:03:33,327 --> 00:03:36,763
- You go too...
- No, no. Err, Praxis? Where are you?

39
00:03:36,927 --> 00:03:39,202
- Here, Caesar.
- He knows where it is.

40
00:03:39,367 --> 00:03:41,835
Wait till you see it, really.

41
00:03:43,487 --> 00:03:46,524
- You must come again some time.
- Any time.

42
00:03:49,487 --> 00:03:53,480
I was wondering how long it would
take you to knock that over.

43
00:03:53,647 --> 00:03:55,319
How can you be so clumsy?.

44
00:03:55,487 --> 00:03:58,126
(LIVIA) Leave it alone,
for heaven's sake.

45
00:03:58,287 --> 00:04:01,597
If you want to clear up,
you can work in the kitchens.

46
00:04:01,767 --> 00:04:03,564
(ANTONIA) Claudius!

47
00:04:05,047 --> 00:04:08,323
Pina, wake up. It's time to go home.

48
00:04:08,487 --> 00:04:10,717
- Time we all went home.
- Are you leaving?

49
00:04:10,887 --> 00:04:12,957
It's two hours after dark already.

50
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:16,278
Yes, and there's a lot of work
to do tomorrow.

51
00:04:16,447 --> 00:04:19,564
A sleepy head's a foolish one.

52
00:04:21,047 --> 00:04:23,242
What a poet that Horace is, eh?

53
00:04:25,007 --> 00:04:29,683
Livilla, the whole family was here
except your husband. It won't do.

54
00:04:29,847 --> 00:04:32,407
What can I do?
Castor hates family dinners.

55
00:04:32,567 --> 00:04:36,560
I don't understand that. Tiberius,
you must talk to that son of yours.

56
00:04:36,727 --> 00:04:39,400
- He doesn't listen to me.
- Goodnight, Uncle.

57
00:04:39,567 --> 00:04:41,797
Goodnight, my dear.

58
00:04:43,047 --> 00:04:48,075
- Grandfather.
- Goodnight, Germanicus, Pina.

59
00:04:53,447 --> 00:04:55,358
Goodnight, Grandmother.

60
00:04:55,527 --> 00:04:57,677
That's my foot you're treading on.

61
00:04:57,847 --> 00:04:59,883
- Are we going?
- Sorry.

62
00:05:01,007 --> 00:05:03,043
(ANTONIA) Claudius, do come on.

63
00:05:06,247 --> 00:05:10,206
Postumus, I'll come and see your troops.
How are they shaping up?

64
00:05:10,367 --> 00:05:12,517
- Very well
- Good.

65
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,723
Goodnight. Goodnight, everyone.

66
00:05:14,887 --> 00:05:17,685
- Goodnight, Domitia.
- Goodnight, Grandfather.

67
00:05:17,847 --> 00:05:20,486
Ah, goodnight, Livilla.

68
00:05:21,447 --> 00:05:25,281
You tell that husband of yours...
You know what to tell him.

69
00:05:25,447 --> 00:05:27,642
- Grandmother.
- Goodnight, my dear.

70
00:05:27,807 --> 00:05:31,800
- You looked very lovely tonight.
- Thank you. Goodnight, Uncle.

71
00:05:34,287 --> 00:05:38,360
- Goodnight, G-Grandfather.
- What?. Oh, goodnight, Claudius.

72
00:05:41,527 --> 00:05:43,563
What a wonderful avenging.

73
00:05:44,527 --> 00:05:49,521
They’re such good children. I think
they liked their little presents.

74
00:05:49,687 --> 00:05:52,918
What are we going to do
about Claudius?

75
00:05:53,087 --> 00:05:55,078
Claudius? In the matter of what?.

76
00:05:55,247 --> 00:05:58,239
The games to be held
in his father's honour.

77
00:05:58,407 --> 00:06:01,285
I don't know.
Must we think about it now?.

78
00:06:01,447 --> 00:06:06,316
How much longer can we leave it?.
Is he to sit in your box or is he not?.

79
00:06:06,487 --> 00:06:10,162
- It'll look odd if he doesn't.
- It might look odder if he does.

80
00:06:10,327 --> 00:06:12,636
Do you want to sit
next to a twitching idiot?.

81
00:06:12,807 --> 00:06:15,924
Let's think about it tomorrow.
Goodnight, my dear.

82
00:06:16,087 --> 00:06:18,123
Don't worry about Claudius.

83
00:06:18,287 --> 00:06:21,962
I'll have him to dinner a few times
and see how he gets on.

84
00:06:22,847 --> 00:06:25,441
If we could just stop
that twitching.

85
00:06:25,967 --> 00:06:30,119
Caesar, forgive me, but a courier
has just arrived from Germany.

86
00:06:30,287 --> 00:06:34,246
Are you mad? Do you expect me
to read despatches at this time?

87
00:06:34,407 --> 00:06:38,241
But it's urgent, Caesar.
There's been a terrible disaster.

88
00:06:41,327 --> 00:06:43,636
- Send him in.
- Come in, come in.

89
00:06:55,407 --> 00:06:57,637
Is this the way
you present yourself?.

90
00:06:57,807 --> 00:06:59,718
Couldn't you have taken a bath?

91
00:06:59,887 --> 00:07:03,402
Forgive me, Caesar.
I would not have presumed...

92
00:07:03,567 --> 00:07:06,877
- Which legion are you with?
- I was with the 19th.

93
00:07:07,047 --> 00:07:09,197
Was? Have you been transferred?

94
00:07:09,367 --> 00:07:12,643
No, Caesar. The 19th legion
does not exist anymore.

95
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:15,401
Nor does the 17th, nor the 18th.

96
00:07:16,247 --> 00:07:20,320
The army of Quinctilius Varus was
massacred in the Teutoberg Forest.

97
00:07:20,487 --> 00:07:24,446
Nothing stands between the German
tribes and our provinces in Gaul

98
00:07:25,287 --> 00:07:26,845
Massacred?

99
00:07:27,727 --> 00:07:29,604
What are you saying to me?

100
00:07:31,007 --> 00:07:33,999
There is no army
in Across-the-Rhine Germany.

101
00:07:35,327 --> 00:07:37,716
Troops and orderlies...

102
00:07:38,647 --> 00:07:43,437
auxiliaries and general staff...
massacred to a man.

103
00:07:44,607 --> 00:07:47,519
Those who survived the battle
were hunted down.

104
00:07:47,687 --> 00:07:49,518
Where is Varus?

105
00:07:50,247 --> 00:07:54,525
Dead. When he saw that all was lost,
he killed himself.

106
00:07:58,487 --> 00:08:00,557
Three legions?

107
00:08:01,927 --> 00:08:05,158
Three legions, Caesar.
There's nothing left.

108
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:30,285
Send for Germanicus and Postumus.
Hurry!

109
00:08:31,447 --> 00:08:33,597
Come to the study. Come with us!

110
00:08:36,247 --> 00:08:38,807
They caught us here and here.

111
00:08:39,447 --> 00:08:41,483
We were on a punitive expedition

112
00:08:41,647 --> 00:08:44,366
because a tax collector
had been murdered.

113
00:08:45,047 --> 00:08:49,006
He sent three legions
on a punitive expedition?

114
00:08:51,127 --> 00:08:53,163
Not at first, Caesar, no.

115
00:08:53,327 --> 00:08:57,002
We'd suffered some early defeats,
so he sent back for the rest.

116
00:08:57,167 --> 00:08:59,317
What happened to the loyal Germans?

117
00:08:59,487 --> 00:09:02,763
They betrayed us. They led us
into the forest and vanished.

118
00:09:03,927 --> 00:09:05,679
But weren't you warned?

119
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:10,884
Many times, Caesar.

120
00:09:12,287 --> 00:09:13,845
Go on.

121
00:09:14,007 --> 00:09:18,364
We'd err... We'd had a mass
of intelligence

122
00:09:18,527 --> 00:09:22,076
warning us that things
were happening in the villages.

123
00:09:22,247 --> 00:09:23,726
Go on.

124
00:09:24,287 --> 00:09:26,403
The commander ignored it, sir.

125
00:09:28,047 --> 00:09:32,518
That stiff-knocked fool! I should
never have appointed him! Go on.

126
00:09:32,687 --> 00:09:34,678
We were advancing along a track.

127
00:09:34,847 --> 00:09:37,361
We didn't even put out
advance guards.

128
00:09:37,527 --> 00:09:40,246
Progress was slow
because we were felling trees

129
00:09:40,407 --> 00:09:43,956
and the tribes had time to gather.
Then it started to rain.

130
00:09:44,127 --> 00:09:48,120
The archers couldn't keep their bows dry
and their shields became soaked.

131
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,198
Our carts got stuck in the mud.

132
00:09:50,367 --> 00:09:54,042
When the Germans attacked,
we were in a hopeless position.

133
00:09:59,087 --> 00:10:01,078
What's happened?

134
00:10:02,247 --> 00:10:05,683
The army east of the Rhine
has been destroyed. All of it.

135
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:10,600
Nothing stands between the Germans
and our provinces in Gaul

136
00:10:17,207 --> 00:10:19,198
How did you get out?.

137
00:10:19,367 --> 00:10:22,643
Only one officer kept his head -
Cassius Chaerea.

138
00:10:22,807 --> 00:10:26,117
About 120 of us cut our way out
and back to the fort.

139
00:10:26,287 --> 00:10:29,085
- The others are still there.
- All right.

140
00:10:30,407 --> 00:10:32,398
Did the Germans take any prisoners?

141
00:10:33,127 --> 00:10:37,962
Yes. They put them in wicker cages
and burned them alive.

142
00:10:47,487 --> 00:10:51,844
Lady, I can't find Postumus Agrippa.
He's not in his room.

143
00:10:52,767 --> 00:10:57,887
Praxis, did it occur to you
he may have visited his wife's room?

144
00:10:58,047 --> 00:11:01,437
Naturally I tried there.
But he wasn't there either.

145
00:11:01,607 --> 00:11:03,916
I then spoke
to one of the palace guards,

146
00:11:04,087 --> 00:11:08,683
who said he'd seen him going towards
your grand-daughter's apartments.

147
00:11:10,647 --> 00:11:12,797
- Livilla?
- Yes.

148
00:11:12,967 --> 00:11:16,084
Naturally, I didn't enquire further
because...

149
00:11:17,287 --> 00:11:20,836
Because her husband
has not yet returned.

150
00:11:23,407 --> 00:11:27,559
With the men Postumus has been
training, it's about a legion.

151
00:11:27,727 --> 00:11:31,720
It depends whether the Germans
have seized the Rhine bridges.

152
00:11:31,887 --> 00:11:36,005
They won't have taken them.
They’re barbarians. They’ll go for plunder.

153
00:11:36,167 --> 00:11:38,283
Then we'll have to secure
the bridges.

154
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:41,245
- I'll start tomorrow.
- I'll raise the rest.

155
00:11:41,407 --> 00:11:46,276
No. Germanicus stays here.
There'll be panic. I'll need him here.

156
00:11:46,447 --> 00:11:49,757
Well. it was here. It was years ago,
but I saw it.

157
00:11:50,407 --> 00:11:52,557
Then it's been stolen probably.

158
00:11:53,607 --> 00:11:55,882
Ah, here is someone.

159
00:11:59,487 --> 00:12:03,366
There's a book we want to look at.
It's by a Greek called Polemocles.

160
00:12:03,527 --> 00:12:08,396
It's a commentary on Polybius'
Military Tactics. It was here.

161
00:12:08,567 --> 00:12:10,558
I'll see if I can find it.

162
00:12:20,367 --> 00:12:22,437
Why, it's young Claudius, isn't it?.

163
00:12:22,607 --> 00:12:24,006
Yes, it is, sir.

164
00:12:24,167 --> 00:12:26,442
You're studious.
What are you reading.

165
00:12:26,607 --> 00:12:30,282
Romantic rubbish, I'll be bound.
That's all the young want.

166
00:12:30,447 --> 00:12:32,563
What is it that you're reading?

167
00:12:33,567 --> 00:12:37,242
It's your own
History of the C-C-Civil Wars.

168
00:12:37,407 --> 00:12:39,363
It's rubbish, all right.

169
00:12:39,527 --> 00:12:45,284
- So you know who I am?
- Yes, sir. Asinius P-P-Pollio.

170
00:12:45,447 --> 00:12:48,359
One of our g-greatest historians.

171
00:12:49,367 --> 00:12:51,358
One of them? What do you mean?

172
00:12:51,527 --> 00:12:55,725
- One of the t-two greatest.
- And who is the other one?

173
00:13:00,047 --> 00:13:01,878
Livy, of course.

174
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:04,038
Well. there can't be two greatest.

175
00:13:04,207 --> 00:13:07,677
That's shilly-shallying
and an abuse of the Roman tongue.

176
00:13:07,847 --> 00:13:10,998
You must choose. Which one
of us would you rather read?

177
00:13:11,167 --> 00:13:14,762
- Pollio, that's not fair.
- Nonsense. The lad's intelligent.

178
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:18,442
Speak up, boy. Which of us
would you rather read?

179
00:13:18,607 --> 00:13:21,360
Well. it d-d-depends, sir.

180
00:13:21,527 --> 00:13:23,677
- Intelligent, but cowardly.
- No.

181
00:13:23,847 --> 00:13:27,044
I mean, it depends
on what I'm reading for.

182
00:13:27,207 --> 00:13:31,439
For b-beauty of language
I would read Livy,

183
00:13:31,607 --> 00:13:36,920
and for interpretation of fact
I would read P-P-Pollio.

184
00:13:38,247 --> 00:13:41,045
Now you please neither of us
and that's a mistake!

185
00:13:41,207 --> 00:13:44,882
I wasn't t-trying to please,
just to tell the truth.

186
00:13:46,207 --> 00:13:48,926
He might make an historian
after all

187
00:13:49,087 --> 00:13:52,682
The book isn't here. Perhaps
you meant the Octavian library?.

188
00:13:52,847 --> 00:13:56,157
I'm not so old that I don't know
what library I'm in!

189
00:13:56,327 --> 00:13:59,956
Excuse me. The book you want,

190
00:14:00,127 --> 00:14:03,802
it's on the t-t-top shelf,
fourth from the window at the back.

191
00:14:03,967 --> 00:14:05,605
I had it out the other day.

192
00:14:05,767 --> 00:14:09,203
Only the t-t-title
is Dissertation on Tactics

193
00:14:09,367 --> 00:14:13,997
and it's by P-P-Polemocrates,
not Polemocles,

194
00:14:14,167 --> 00:14:19,195
and he was a J-J-Jew, not a Greek.

195
00:14:23,447 --> 00:14:28,521
You'd better be right. I don't take
kindly to that many corrections!

196
00:14:32,287 --> 00:14:35,916
- Have I upset him?
- Yes. It'll do him good.

197
00:14:37,087 --> 00:14:39,362
- Do you like history?.
- Yes, sir.

198
00:14:39,527 --> 00:14:42,963
But who the devil are you?
Livy called you Claudius.

199
00:14:43,127 --> 00:14:48,155
I'm T-T-Tiberius Claudius
D-Drusus Nero Germanicus.

200
00:14:48,327 --> 00:14:52,286
Oh, that Claudius!
They told me you were a half-wit.

201
00:14:53,367 --> 00:14:57,042
Well. my f-family's ashamed of me
because I s-s...

202
00:15:00,927 --> 00:15:05,557
stammer, and I'm lame
and my head twitches.

203
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:09,003
Yes, I've noticed that.
Can't you stop it?.

204
00:15:09,167 --> 00:15:13,445
No. The doctors said
I might g-g-grow out of it.

205
00:15:15,007 --> 00:15:18,044
Why were you reading
my History of the Civil Wars?

206
00:15:18,207 --> 00:15:23,645
Oh, I'm gathering material for
a life of my father and grandfather.

207
00:15:24,647 --> 00:15:26,524
Oh, I remember them.

208
00:15:26,687 --> 00:15:29,645
They both believed in the Republic.

209
00:15:29,807 --> 00:15:32,196
I know they did.
That's why they died.

210
00:15:32,367 --> 00:15:34,323
I beg your pardon?

211
00:15:34,487 --> 00:15:36,876
I mean, that's why they were poisoned.

212
00:15:39,567 --> 00:15:43,116
- P-p-p-poisoned!
- Sh! Not so loud.

213
00:15:46,407 --> 00:15:49,604
I won't mention any names,
but I'll tell you this.

214
00:15:50,647 --> 00:15:53,480
You say you're writing
a life of your father?.

215
00:15:53,647 --> 00:15:55,638
They won't let you finish it.

216
00:15:55,807 --> 00:15:57,559
Who won't?.

217
00:15:58,167 --> 00:16:02,399
Never mind. Look here, Claudius,
I'll give you some good advice.

218
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:05,636
Do you want to live
a long and useful life?

219
00:16:06,287 --> 00:16:09,882
In that case, exaggerate
your stutter and your limp.

220
00:16:10,047 --> 00:16:14,484
Let your wits wander and play
the fool as much as you like.

221
00:16:14,647 --> 00:16:16,478
Do you understand me?

222
00:16:17,447 --> 00:16:20,325
It's a pleasure to talk to you.
I must find Livy.

223
00:16:20,487 --> 00:16:22,045
P-P-Poisoned?

224
00:16:26,287 --> 00:16:29,996
There's nothing like a piece of food
picked fresh from a tree,

225
00:16:30,167 --> 00:16:32,727
or a field or a stalk.

226
00:16:32,887 --> 00:16:36,243
It's very nice, but you didn't
ask me here to taste figs.

227
00:16:39,567 --> 00:16:42,035
Did you ever think
how fortunate we are?

228
00:16:42,207 --> 00:16:45,358
That we weren't born in a hut
on the banks of the Rhine,

229
00:16:45,527 --> 00:16:48,200
or in a grubby little tent in Syria.

230
00:16:48,367 --> 00:16:50,562
Did you ever think what Rome means?

231
00:16:50,727 --> 00:16:53,002
Do you understand the effort

232
00:16:53,167 --> 00:16:56,955
that has gone into making this
little place master of the world?

233
00:16:57,127 --> 00:17:00,517
Do you understand the dedication
needed to maintain it?.

234
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:03,406
Are you displeased with me,
Grandfather?.

235
00:17:03,567 --> 00:17:05,000
Sit down.

236
00:17:06,127 --> 00:17:08,197
Listen, Postumus.

237
00:17:08,367 --> 00:17:10,676
We can't afford to sleep, you know.

238
00:17:10,847 --> 00:17:14,396
Other people think only
of their bread and their circuses,

239
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:16,444
but we have to provide them.

240
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:20,001
I hear nothing but complaints
about you.

241
00:17:20,167 --> 00:17:22,727
- What sort of complaint?.
- Well. all sorts.

242
00:17:22,887 --> 00:17:25,606
You threw a palace guard
into the fountain.

243
00:17:25,767 --> 00:17:29,123
- He was laughing at Claudius.
- Everyone laughs at Claudius.

244
00:17:29,287 --> 00:17:31,755
Will you throw them all
in the fountain?

245
00:17:31,927 --> 00:17:34,600
And people say you're rude
and bad-tempered.

246
00:17:34,767 --> 00:17:38,157
- Who says?
- Livia complains about you a lot.

247
00:17:38,327 --> 00:17:39,885
What does she say?.

248
00:17:40,047 --> 00:17:44,723
Well. she says, for example,
that you're a bit of a rake. Is it true?

249
00:17:46,487 --> 00:17:50,639
The night that the courier brought
news from Germany, I sent for you.

250
00:17:51,367 --> 00:17:54,200
Yes. You weren't in your room.

251
00:17:55,927 --> 00:17:58,760
Your wife complains
you don't sleep with her enough.

252
00:17:58,927 --> 00:18:02,044
- I never wanted that marriage.
- You could sleep with her.

253
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:05,961
She's the same as any other woman.
It's for us to set an example.

254
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:10,166
Without proper family life,
where will we find people to carry on?

255
00:18:11,207 --> 00:18:14,643
Why has my inheritance
from my father been withheld?

256
00:18:14,807 --> 00:18:17,037
Oh, that's what's bothering you.

257
00:18:17,207 --> 00:18:20,882
You'll get it when I think
you're mature enough to use it.

258
00:18:21,047 --> 00:18:24,960
- Do I have to sit an examination?
- Don't be cheeky with me.

259
00:18:25,127 --> 00:18:29,598
Now, you listen.
Your father was my greatest friend.

260
00:18:29,767 --> 00:18:34,841
He would have taken over. And that's
what I looked for in his sons.

261
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:39,606
Both your brothers are dead
and you're all I've left of him.

262
00:18:39,767 --> 00:18:42,565
It's my intention
that you should follow me.

263
00:18:47,087 --> 00:18:50,523
- My step-father may not agree.
- Let me worry about Tiberius.

264
00:18:50,687 --> 00:18:52,962
You made him your adopted son
as well

265
00:18:53,127 --> 00:18:57,200
I did it out of respect for
his mother. She's an amazing woman.

266
00:18:57,367 --> 00:19:00,837
But we just don't get on.
I've never liked him.

267
00:19:01,007 --> 00:19:03,965
He's not right to succeed me,
whatever Livia thinks.

268
00:19:04,127 --> 00:19:07,324
I say "succeed",
but we are not kings.

269
00:19:07,487 --> 00:19:09,876
We have no divine right to rule.

270
00:19:10,047 --> 00:19:13,039
Still. after all my years
of service to the state,

271
00:19:13,207 --> 00:19:16,324
I think the Senate
will accept my recommendation.

272
00:19:16,487 --> 00:19:20,844
But you must earn it. You must
give me confidence in you.

273
00:19:21,407 --> 00:19:23,079
(KNOCKING)

274
00:19:25,487 --> 00:19:27,045
Come.

275
00:19:33,207 --> 00:19:36,404
Grandmother?. You sent for me.

276
00:19:38,647 --> 00:19:40,558
How are you?

277
00:19:44,687 --> 00:19:46,166
Grandmother?.

278
00:19:48,807 --> 00:19:51,605
Why do you deceive your husband
when he's away?.

279
00:19:51,767 --> 00:19:54,600
Deceive? I don't understand.

280
00:19:54,767 --> 00:19:58,521
Why do you allow Postumus Agrippa
into your room at night?.

281
00:19:58,687 --> 00:20:01,440
But I don't! Who said such a thing?

282
00:20:02,807 --> 00:20:05,082
Come here.

283
00:20:09,407 --> 00:20:12,046
You're not going to lie to me,
are you?

284
00:20:12,207 --> 00:20:14,562
You're not going to treat me
like a fool?.

285
00:20:16,167 --> 00:20:20,718
Do you think that I wouldn't know
what happens under my own roof?.

286
00:20:22,687 --> 00:20:26,965
I've had you watched, child,
and Postumus Agrippa...

287
00:20:27,767 --> 00:20:31,316
as I had his mother watched -
your Aunt Julia.

288
00:20:32,287 --> 00:20:34,403
Do you remember her?.

289
00:20:35,407 --> 00:20:38,479
She was sent to an island
called Pandataria.

290
00:20:38,647 --> 00:20:41,559
It's a few minutes walk
from end to end.

291
00:20:41,727 --> 00:20:45,163
Well. I shouldn't think
she walks it much anymore.

292
00:20:46,327 --> 00:20:49,160
She's been on it for seven years.

293
00:20:49,327 --> 00:20:52,797
Oh, God! I didn't mean it.

294
00:20:53,647 --> 00:20:56,286
I didn't mean it!
I won't ever do it again.

295
00:20:58,727 --> 00:21:00,638
Don't send me away.

296
00:21:00,807 --> 00:21:06,120
Please. Please. I won't ever
see him again, I swear it.

297
00:21:26,007 --> 00:21:30,558
You were always a naughty little girl,
you know that, don't you?

298
00:21:31,647 --> 00:21:34,400
Your mother never punished you
enough.

299
00:21:34,567 --> 00:21:36,558
You won't tell Augustus, will you?

300
00:21:36,727 --> 00:21:39,924
He'll send me away if you do
and I couldn't bear it!

301
00:21:40,087 --> 00:21:43,796
Well. perhaps
that won't be necessary.

302
00:21:45,247 --> 00:21:47,522
Oh, come on, dry your tears.

303
00:21:50,607 --> 00:21:52,006
There.

304
00:21:53,127 --> 00:21:54,640
That's better.

305
00:21:56,407 --> 00:21:58,602
Such a beautiful girl

306
00:22:00,407 --> 00:22:02,762
I was beautiful too once, you know?.

307
00:22:02,927 --> 00:22:06,283
They say you were the most beautiful
woman in the world.

308
00:22:07,127 --> 00:22:11,678
There was one other,
but she was in Egypt.

309
00:22:13,487 --> 00:22:17,002
And, besides, she didn't last
as long as I did.

310
00:22:20,087 --> 00:22:26,276
Now, about Postumus Agrippa.
You're not in love with him, are you?

311
00:22:26,447 --> 00:22:27,766
No.

312
00:22:27,927 --> 00:22:30,487
He pestered you, I suppose,
and you gave in.

313
00:22:30,647 --> 00:22:35,038
- What frail creatures we women are.
- He always wanted me.

314
00:22:35,207 --> 00:22:39,041
And you always enjoyed teasing him.
Yes, you did, I've seen it.

315
00:22:39,207 --> 00:22:42,040
I swear to you I won't do it again.

316
00:22:42,207 --> 00:22:46,439
Yes, well. let's not be in too much
of a hurry to swear anything.

317
00:22:49,607 --> 00:22:55,842
My dear, I must talk to you
like a grown woman now.

318
00:22:57,527 --> 00:23:01,918
Can I talk to you?
Can I open my heart to you?

319
00:23:02,167 --> 00:23:04,635
Oh, yes, Grandmother, yes.

320
00:23:05,527 --> 00:23:09,236
Many years ago,
before you were born,

321
00:23:09,407 --> 00:23:13,116
we all went through
the terrible agony of civil war.

322
00:23:13,287 --> 00:23:17,041
Rome tottered and shook
and nearly fell

323
00:23:18,567 --> 00:23:20,558
I'm afraid that may happen again.

324
00:23:21,887 --> 00:23:23,479
And will it?.

325
00:23:23,647 --> 00:23:25,763
I'm sure of one thing.

326
00:23:26,487 --> 00:23:30,162
Only a single hand at the helm
will keep this ship on course.

327
00:23:30,327 --> 00:23:33,080
The question is,
whose hand will it be?

328
00:23:33,247 --> 00:23:37,399
If there is any doubt, the rivalry
will plunge us into civil war again.

329
00:23:39,447 --> 00:23:42,564
- Is there a doubt?.
- Not in my mind.

330
00:23:43,407 --> 00:23:45,398
But there is in someone else's.

331
00:23:46,687 --> 00:23:48,086
Augustus.

332
00:23:49,207 --> 00:23:50,845
Yes.

333
00:23:51,767 --> 00:23:54,679
And it's my duty to remove
that doubt.

334
00:23:55,327 --> 00:24:00,003
Through everything I've ever done,
that has been my only object.

335
00:24:00,847 --> 00:24:02,917
And now it must become yours.

336
00:24:05,927 --> 00:24:07,406
How, Grandmother?.

337
00:24:08,887 --> 00:24:11,879
You want your husband
to become Emperor of Rome?

338
00:24:13,767 --> 00:24:15,086
Yes.

339
00:24:15,247 --> 00:24:18,876
Then his father must become Emperor
before him.

340
00:24:19,807 --> 00:24:25,359
Tiberius must succeed Augustus
if Castor is to succeed Tiberius.

341
00:24:25,527 --> 00:24:28,644
Only then will the line
become established.

342
00:24:28,807 --> 00:24:31,924
It'll seem easier to accept it
than reject it.

343
00:24:34,127 --> 00:24:35,719
And Postumus?

344
00:24:35,887 --> 00:24:40,324
Bravo, my dear,
you've put your finger on it.

345
00:24:40,487 --> 00:24:43,001
Yes. Postumus.

346
00:24:44,207 --> 00:24:47,961
As always, we come back to Postumus.

347
00:24:53,967 --> 00:24:57,926
Nothing! That's what it amounts to -
he's done nothing!

348
00:24:58,087 --> 00:25:00,840
He holds bridges,
but he doesn't cross them.

349
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:04,676
He's playing some game of his own!

350
00:25:04,847 --> 00:25:06,838
(KNOCKING)
Come in!

351
00:25:11,167 --> 00:25:15,479
What's your son up to?! Six months,
and all he's got are the bridges!

352
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:18,161
- He sits on his arse all day!
- What does he say?.

353
00:25:18,327 --> 00:25:21,797
He says nothing, that's what.
That's what it amounts to.

354
00:25:22,447 --> 00:25:25,359
Those damned barbarians
have got my eagles!

355
00:25:25,527 --> 00:25:28,997
Quinctilius Varus,
where are my eagles?!

356
00:25:29,167 --> 00:25:30,839
Leave.

357
00:25:35,247 --> 00:25:37,966
He is cautious, naturally.

358
00:25:38,127 --> 00:25:42,279
I sent him to get my eagles back,
not to sit on the Rhine!

359
00:25:42,447 --> 00:25:45,757
He has an army of recruits.
Should he risk another ambush?

360
00:25:45,927 --> 00:25:49,203
If he doesn't risk something
he should have stayed here!

361
00:25:49,367 --> 00:25:53,360
- He's playing some game of his own.
- That's a childish thing to say!

362
00:25:53,527 --> 00:25:55,404
Is it?. Why doesn't he get my eagles?

363
00:25:55,567 --> 00:25:58,240
He'll move when he judges
the army ready.

364
00:25:58,407 --> 00:26:02,161
He'll move now! I'll send Postumus
with an army to make sure!

365
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:04,238
I think that wouldn't be wise.

366
00:26:05,767 --> 00:26:08,361
I make the military decisions,
not you!

367
00:26:08,527 --> 00:26:11,121
There's no need to lose your temper.

368
00:26:12,367 --> 00:26:15,404
I wouldn't dream of advising you
on such matters.

369
00:26:15,567 --> 00:26:17,922
My son would welcome reinforcements.

370
00:26:18,087 --> 00:26:21,204
- I question only sending Postumus.
- Why?.

371
00:26:21,367 --> 00:26:24,723
- He's unproved and untried.
- Oh, you always say that!

372
00:26:24,887 --> 00:26:27,560
That's because it's always true.

373
00:26:28,807 --> 00:26:33,483
He's the obvious person to send.
He's been training recruits for months.

374
00:26:33,647 --> 00:26:36,605
Training and leading men
into battle are not the same.

375
00:26:36,767 --> 00:26:40,919
Oh! How will he ever learn
if he never does anything?

376
00:26:41,087 --> 00:26:43,237
His brother was Governor of Syria
at 19.

377
00:26:43,407 --> 00:26:45,238
Gaius was different.

378
00:26:45,407 --> 00:26:48,365
You had confidence in him
and so did the Senate.

379
00:26:48,527 --> 00:26:52,156
Gaius was reliable. He was
a statesman. We all loved him.

380
00:26:52,327 --> 00:26:55,319
- Yes, but Postumus...
- Postumus is unpredictable.

381
00:26:55,487 --> 00:27:00,436
And if you send Postumus,
Tiberius will regard it as a criticism.

382
00:27:00,607 --> 00:27:04,919
Good! That's what it's meant to be.
I'm not inquiring after his health!

383
00:27:05,087 --> 00:27:09,319
There's a history of antagonism
between Postumus and Tiberius.

384
00:27:09,487 --> 00:27:14,242
Tiberius will regard Postumus
more of a spy than a support.

385
00:27:14,407 --> 00:27:16,841
He'll think you don't trust him.

386
00:27:17,727 --> 00:27:19,445
That's ridiculous!

387
00:27:19,607 --> 00:27:23,316
Haven't you said you think
he's playing some game of his own?

388
00:27:25,287 --> 00:27:28,916
If you want to avoid friction
between the commanders,

389
00:27:29,087 --> 00:27:32,159
then I suggest you send Germanicus.

390
00:27:35,527 --> 00:27:40,123
All right, I'll send Germanicus!
But I want my damned eagles back!

391
00:27:44,207 --> 00:27:45,640
What's this?

392
00:27:45,807 --> 00:27:48,879
It's a biography.
The beginning of one, anyway.

393
00:27:49,047 --> 00:27:51,641
- A biography of whom?
- By whom is the point.

394
00:27:51,807 --> 00:27:55,959
It's by my idiot grandson Claudius.
Antonia found it in his study.

395
00:27:56,127 --> 00:27:58,118
You don't expect me to read it?.

396
00:27:58,287 --> 00:28:00,847
No. I'm having it destroyed.
It's subversive.

397
00:28:01,007 --> 00:28:04,682
- I told him not to continue it.
- How is it subversive?

398
00:28:04,847 --> 00:28:08,920
He praises his father's only fault -
his attachment to the Republic.

399
00:28:11,487 --> 00:28:15,400
He's harmless enough. You don't
want me to punish him, do you?

400
00:28:15,567 --> 00:28:16,966
No.

401
00:28:17,127 --> 00:28:21,757
But I do want a decision on whether
he'll sit in your box at the Games.

402
00:28:22,487 --> 00:28:25,047
The games are in honour of his father.

403
00:28:25,207 --> 00:28:28,916
If we send Germanicus off,
neither of his sons will be in the box.

404
00:28:29,087 --> 00:28:31,123
He should be there, but at the back.

405
00:28:31,287 --> 00:28:34,438
I hope you don't think
I'm going to pay for these games.

406
00:28:34,607 --> 00:28:37,167
So that's how you feel
about the Games!

407
00:28:37,327 --> 00:28:40,717
No. I just feel like that
about paying for them!

408
00:28:40,887 --> 00:28:42,559
Nobody's asking you to pay!

409
00:28:43,967 --> 00:28:46,276
Yes. As long as that's understood.

410
00:28:46,447 --> 00:28:48,324
Was it ever in doubt?.

411
00:28:48,487 --> 00:28:53,845
Antonia and I will pay for the Games,
and Germanicus and Claudius.

412
00:28:54,007 --> 00:28:57,841
Claudius? That's even more reason
why he should be in the box.

413
00:28:58,007 --> 00:29:00,237
It'll be a very expensive seat.

414
00:29:00,407 --> 00:29:02,682
And when is he going to get married?

415
00:29:02,847 --> 00:29:05,315
- This year.
- You said that last year.

416
00:29:05,487 --> 00:29:07,318
Yes, but I put it off.

417
00:29:08,607 --> 00:29:12,520
- Will this girl marry him?
- What's it got to do with her?.

418
00:29:12,687 --> 00:29:15,155
They were betrothed six years ago.

419
00:29:15,327 --> 00:29:18,524
To be honest, I feel sorry for her.
What's she like?

420
00:29:18,687 --> 00:29:21,997
I don't know. I haven't
seen her since she was 13

421
00:29:22,167 --> 00:29:25,125
- Does she know what she's getting?
- Do any of us?

422
00:29:25,287 --> 00:29:29,758
Look, you've left these matters
to me for the last 30 years.

423
00:29:29,927 --> 00:29:31,804
Are you going to interfere now?.

424
00:29:31,967 --> 00:29:35,642
I was asking a question.
Can't I ask a question anymore?

425
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:38,765
What's wrong with you?
Why are you so bad tempered?!

426
00:29:38,927 --> 00:29:40,918
It's you that's bad tempered!

427
00:29:41,727 --> 00:29:45,197
Your temper gets worse by the day.
Everybody notices it!

428
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:47,881
I think you could do with a rest!

429
00:29:49,007 --> 00:29:50,520

00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:53,600
who was worth the lot of you
put together.

454
00:32:54,607 --> 00:32:58,316
It's my intention that these games
shall be remembered

455
00:32:58,487 --> 00:33:03,197
long after you're dead and forgotten
even by your nearest and dearest.

456
00:33:03,367 --> 00:33:05,722
You're all scum and you know it,

457
00:33:05,887 --> 00:33:08,355
but you've a chance here -
some of you -

458
00:33:08,527 --> 00:33:11,121
to prove that you're a bit more
than that.

459
00:33:11,287 --> 00:33:14,404
And for those whom death
doesn't liberate,

460
00:33:14,567 --> 00:33:18,355
there'll be plenty of freedoms
handed out afterwards -

461
00:33:18,527 --> 00:33:21,087
to say nothing of gold plate and coin.

462
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:26,919
But I want a good show.

463
00:33:27,887 --> 00:33:30,401
I want my money’s worth!

464
00:33:31,287 --> 00:33:34,279
I don't want any
kiss-in-the-ring stuff.

465
00:33:34,927 --> 00:33:38,158
And I don't want my family
watching two grown men

466
00:33:38,327 --> 00:33:41,637
pussyfooting around each other
for half an hour.

467
00:33:41,807 --> 00:33:43,877
There's been too much of that.

468
00:33:44,047 --> 00:33:47,278
Don't think you can fool me -
I know every trick in the book,

469
00:33:47,447 --> 00:33:51,679
like the pig's blood in the bladder
to make it look as if you're dead.

470
00:33:51,847 --> 00:33:54,759
There's been too much
of that too lately.

471
00:33:54,927 --> 00:33:58,556
These games are being degraded

472
00:33:58,727 --> 00:34:03,357
by the increasing use
of professional tricks to stay alive,

473
00:34:03,527 --> 00:34:05,404
and I won't have it.

474
00:34:06,407 --> 00:34:11,003
So put on a good show and there'll
be plenty of money for the living

475
00:34:11,167 --> 00:34:13,158
and a decent burial for the dead.

476
00:34:13,927 --> 00:34:17,681
If not, I'll break this guild up...

477
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:22,243
and I'll send the lot of you
to the mines in Numidia.

478
00:34:26,287 --> 00:34:28,357
That's all I have to say.

No, I don't.

- I don't remember.

memory she honours in those games -

ask her how he died!

that they were all murdered?

that you want me to think you are?

You think that by pretending to be mad
that I'll be lenient with you.

- It's him that's unclean, not you.

Tomorrow, you and I will go
the temple and make a sacrifice together.

Get in beside her. That's your place.

this would not have happened!

put Livilla up to it?.

I'm certain of it.

601
00:45:42,447 --> 00:45:46,440
I'll go. If Livia knows I've been here,
your life won't be worth much.

to know the truth, and Germanicus.

603
00:45:50,967 --> 00:45:54,642
I'll tell him.
But, listen, stay alive.

604

Don't give them any excuse
to k-k-kill you.

00:46:04,607 --> 00:46:07,326
Don't worry.
It'll be a very small affair.

607
00:46:07,487 --> 00:46:10,047
I embarrass them all far too much.

608
00:46:10,207 --> 00:46:12,596
Good. Go on embarrassing them.

609
00:46:22,327 --> 00:46:25,364
Go on playing the idiot.
It's safer that way.

610
00:46:25,527 --> 00:46:30,647
Somebody else said that to me
a while ago. Asinius P-Pollio.

611
00:46:31,367 --> 00:46:34,803
Then we're not the only ones
who know what's going on.

612
00:46:37,647 --> 00:46:39,444
Goodbye, old friend.

613
00:47:02,487 --> 00:47:05,320
(SHOUTING OUTSIDE)

614
00:49:01,327 --> 00:49:03,443
(SOME TITTERING)

615
00:49:44,927 --> 00:49:46,918
(LIVIA) She grew!

616
00:49:47,087 --> 00:49:51,763
She just kept on growing!

617
00:50:02,247 --> 00:50:04,681
(LAUGHTER ECHOES)
