1
00:00:51,687 --> 00:00:53,405
It's from Herod.

2
00:00:54,327 --> 00:00:58,400
- What does he say?.
- Oh, it's written from J-Jerusalem.

3
00:00:59,527 --> 00:01:02,166
Read it to me.
His letters are so amusing.

4
00:01:02,327 --> 00:01:04,079
"My dear old friend,

5
00:01:04,247 --> 00:01:08,126
"what is all this I hear
about you living in three rooms

6
00:01:08,287 --> 00:01:10,517
"in the p-poor quarter of town?

7
00:01:10,687 --> 00:01:12,643
"Is it serious?

8
00:01:14,287 --> 00:01:16,437
"Why did you not write to me?

9
00:01:16,607 --> 00:01:19,246
"Is it that absurd p-pride of yours?

10
00:01:19,407 --> 00:01:21,875
"Well. I shall attend to that
shortly.

11
00:01:22,047 --> 00:01:26,643
"Meanwhile, knowing how loath
you are to accept money

12
00:01:26,807 --> 00:01:30,436
"and being the only p-practical
friend you ever had,

13
00:01:30,607 --> 00:01:35,158
"I enclose a little p-p-present
for you.

14
00:01:35,327 --> 00:01:38,399
"Please make proper use of it.
Herod."

15
00:01:38,567 --> 00:01:42,480
- What is it?. It seems very small
- Well. I don't know.

16
00:01:47,327 --> 00:01:49,397
I don't think that's very generous.

17
00:01:50,487 --> 00:01:52,045
Venus!

18
00:01:52,207 --> 00:01:55,005
Oh, Claudius, I think your luck
is changing.

19
00:01:56,607 --> 00:01:58,438
I'm sure it's an omen!

20
00:02:03,607 --> 00:02:05,802
Those dice are crooked.

21
00:02:05,967 --> 00:02:08,435
You can't possibly use them!

22
00:02:11,927 --> 00:02:15,203
Oh, dear Herod! How I miss him.

23
00:02:16,167 --> 00:02:19,796
- Master, have you seen this?
- What?.

24
00:02:19,967 --> 00:02:23,243
- It was on the door of the temple.
- What is it?.

25
00:02:23,407 --> 00:02:27,525
It's advertising a brothel
in the palace! They’re all over the city.

26
00:02:27,687 --> 00:02:32,556
A brothel?. In the palace?
But who is to serve in it?.

27
00:02:33,327 --> 00:02:37,286
His sisters, his cousins,
senators and their wives.

28
00:02:37,447 --> 00:02:39,961
- You knew about it?.
- Yes.

29
00:02:41,927 --> 00:02:43,918
Why didn't you tell me?

30
00:02:48,127 --> 00:02:50,083
He wants you there?

31
00:02:50,247 --> 00:02:53,000
He wants me to take the m-money
on the door.

32
00:02:53,167 --> 00:02:55,362
Oh, Claudius.

33
00:02:55,527 --> 00:02:58,280
The monster. The little monster.

34
00:02:59,047 --> 00:03:01,561
Forcing the nobility
into prostitution.

35
00:03:01,967 --> 00:03:03,923
And in the palace!

36
00:03:05,087 --> 00:03:08,841
Even Calpurnia wouldn't serve there,
and it's her profession!

37
00:03:09,007 --> 00:03:11,919
Briseis, that is not
her profession any more!

38
00:03:19,047 --> 00:03:21,959
My dear, that was
and is my profession.

39
00:03:22,127 --> 00:03:24,516
I'm a prostitute
and I'm not ashamed of it.

40
00:03:24,687 --> 00:03:27,042
All the same, I won't serve
in his brothel!

41
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:31,280
Either as d-doorkeeper or chucker out.
There's some price a man won't pay.

42
00:04:46,767 --> 00:04:50,123
- Claudius, she's terrified.
- There's nothing you can do.

43
00:04:50,287 --> 00:04:53,359
Claudius, listen.
She's given birth six weeks ago.

44
00:04:53,527 --> 00:04:56,678
- I'm afraid of what she'll do.
- There are no exceptions.

45
00:04:56,847 --> 00:04:59,566
There must be a room
to put her in. Please!

46
00:04:59,727 --> 00:05:03,402
Do you want my throat cut
along with yours?! You've paid, go in!

47
00:05:03,567 --> 00:05:05,125
Enjoy yourself.

48
00:05:05,567 --> 00:05:07,558
- Come, it's not important.
- No.

49
00:05:07,727 --> 00:05:10,958
Do you want the child left
without a mother?. Come on.

50
00:05:12,367 --> 00:05:14,483
Ah, another customer.

51
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,842
And we were just running out of men.

52
00:05:18,007 --> 00:05:19,565
Real men.

53
00:05:19,727 --> 00:05:23,925
Sabinus, isn't it?. And I see
you've brought your pretty wife.

54
00:05:25,047 --> 00:05:28,676
My dear, you'll make a fortune
in there tonight.

55
00:05:28,847 --> 00:05:32,920
You'd better, anyway. The Emperor
has just raised his commission.

56
00:05:33,087 --> 00:05:37,285
- Shall we go?
- Ah, reinforcements.

57
00:05:37,447 --> 00:05:40,598
Marcus Vinicius,
the Emperor's brother-in-law

58
00:05:40,767 --> 00:05:43,122
and your first customer.

59
00:05:43,287 --> 00:05:47,599
Make him pay through the nose,
my dear - you're worth it.

60
00:05:50,407 --> 00:05:51,726
Come.

61
00:06:17,487 --> 00:06:19,796
- What are you doing?
- Chucking you out!

62
00:06:19,967 --> 00:06:22,686
- But you've no right!
- That's what I'm here for.

63
00:06:22,847 --> 00:06:24,917
- Why?.
- For creating a disturbance.

64
00:06:25,087 --> 00:06:29,717
- She was creating the disturbance!
- Out! See him off the premises.

65
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,757
- Go home.
- But the Emperor...?

66
00:06:44,927 --> 00:06:48,124
I'll tell him I threw you out
for indecent behaviour.

67
00:06:53,527 --> 00:06:55,916
- You're a good man, Claudius.
- Oh.

68
00:06:56,087 --> 00:06:57,406
Claudius?

69
00:06:59,767 --> 00:07:01,837
We must help him, the Emperor.

70
00:07:02,007 --> 00:07:04,919
- He's your husband. You help him!
- Claudius.

71
00:07:05,087 --> 00:07:08,397
He's sick.
He needs good people around him.

72
00:07:08,567 --> 00:07:12,401
He's killed them all! What are
you doing here in your condition?

73
00:07:12,567 --> 00:07:15,240
He told me to come.
He likes me to be with him.

74
00:07:15,407 --> 00:07:19,446
Has he shown you, naked,
to his G-German guards lately?.

75
00:07:20,727 --> 00:07:24,242
Oh, I'm sorry, Caesonia.

76
00:07:25,047 --> 00:07:27,197
It's not for me to criticise.

77
00:07:27,367 --> 00:07:30,404
I bleat with the rest of them
whenever he appears.

78
00:07:30,567 --> 00:07:33,127
There are no lions among us any more.

79
00:07:43,487 --> 00:07:45,682
What are you doing? Let me go!

80
00:07:52,487 --> 00:07:55,240
(SILENCE FALLS)

81
00:08:01,287 --> 00:08:05,405
"Vulcan, with awkward grace
his office plies,

82
00:08:05,567 --> 00:08:08,923
"while unextinguished laughter
shakes the skies."

83
00:08:09,087 --> 00:08:12,124
Homer. For "Vulcan"
read "Old Uncle Claudius."

84
00:08:13,647 --> 00:08:15,000
Oh...

85
00:08:16,527 --> 00:08:22,079
"Then, from his anvil.
the lame craftsman rose...

86
00:08:23,447 --> 00:08:29,443
"Wide...with distorted legs,
oblique he goes."

87
00:08:30,647 --> 00:08:32,478
Oh, bravo!

88
00:08:32,647 --> 00:08:35,798
Henceforth, Uncle,
you shall be Vulcan.

89
00:08:37,407 --> 00:08:38,840
While I...

90
00:08:40,647 --> 00:08:43,798
Oh, what am I...

91
00:08:45,527 --> 00:08:49,361
but Ulysses returning home

92
00:08:49,527 --> 00:08:53,281
to witness the shame and degradation
of his household.

93
00:08:55,847 --> 00:08:57,166
Cassius.

94
00:08:58,247 --> 00:09:02,001
Did you ever see a sight
as surd and degrading as this?

95
00:09:03,287 --> 00:09:04,879
Shall I arrest them?

96
00:09:05,047 --> 00:09:07,800
No. Let them indulge themselves
a while longer.

97
00:09:07,967 --> 00:09:12,882
Soon, I promise, I shall flush
this savage into the Tiber forever.

98
00:09:14,047 --> 00:09:17,483
Meanwhile, Jove must
cleanse himself in battle.

99
00:09:18,647 --> 00:09:21,400
I have sworn to fight a war
against the Germans

100
00:09:21,567 --> 00:09:23,922
that will end in their annihilation.

101
00:09:24,087 --> 00:09:28,319
I shall bring back booty to Rome,
fill her coffers, enrich her purse.

102
00:09:29,327 --> 00:09:34,765
Cassius, order the detachments
and raise the levies!

103
00:09:36,127 --> 00:09:41,121
I go to forge,
in the white-hot fires of war,

104
00:09:41,287 --> 00:09:43,801
a new and tempered spirit of Rome

105
00:09:43,967 --> 00:09:46,925
that will last a thousand years!

106
00:09:49,967 --> 00:09:52,083
There's a good girl

107
00:09:52,247 --> 00:09:54,044
(KNOCKING)

108
00:09:56,247 --> 00:09:57,760
Claudius!

109
00:09:57,927 --> 00:10:00,725
I brought a little g-gift
for the baby.

110
00:10:00,887 --> 00:10:02,479
Oh, Claudius.

111
00:10:02,647 --> 00:10:04,524
That's lovely.

112
00:10:05,447 --> 00:10:07,756
- Show it to her.
- How is she?

113
00:10:07,927 --> 00:10:09,440
Come and see.

114
00:10:11,927 --> 00:10:15,442
Ah, there. She's very pretty.

115
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:18,044
Yes... She looks just like you.

116
00:10:18,207 --> 00:10:20,323
Come and sit down.

117
00:10:22,127 --> 00:10:24,357
So, how is Calpurnia?

118
00:10:24,527 --> 00:10:27,041
She's well
She sends her felicitations.

119
00:10:27,207 --> 00:10:29,482
I'm going to see the Emperor
in Germany.

120
00:10:29,647 --> 00:10:33,242
I'll be able to report
that you're both looking well

121
00:10:33,407 --> 00:10:36,558
- Why are you going to Germany?.
- Haven't you heard?

122
00:10:36,727 --> 00:10:41,243
- You know they tell me nothing.
- I'm not sure I should tell you.

123
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:45,725
Oh, I suppose you'll hear about it
soon enough.

124
00:10:46,767 --> 00:10:49,759
Well. he has informed the Senate
by letter

125
00:10:49,927 --> 00:10:54,398
that he has uncovered a vast
conspiracy in the army of the Rhine.

126
00:10:55,127 --> 00:10:59,643
Six corps commanders and the army
commander himself, Gaetulicus,

127
00:10:59,807 --> 00:11:01,604
have been executed.

128
00:11:01,767 --> 00:11:04,918
More executions
are still taking place.

129
00:11:06,447 --> 00:11:08,563
Do you think there was a conspiracy?.

130
00:11:08,727 --> 00:11:11,525
Who knows? Would it surprise you?

131
00:11:11,687 --> 00:11:16,203
But Gaetulicus? No.
He was my father's old friend,

132
00:11:16,367 --> 00:11:20,963
my brother's corps commander,
a soldier of iron loyalties.

133
00:11:21,127 --> 00:11:24,483
- No. That's not possible.
- Why are you going, then?

134
00:11:24,647 --> 00:11:28,162
The Senate is sending me,
and two ex-Consuls, to congratulate him

135
00:11:28,327 --> 00:11:30,477
on the s-suppression of the mutiny.

136
00:11:31,247 --> 00:11:36,799
As I said, the only lions
left in Rome are in the arena.

137
00:11:39,527 --> 00:11:42,644
I'm also to strip Livia's apartments
of their valuables

138
00:11:42,807 --> 00:11:46,436
and send them to him by road.
He stresses by road.

139
00:11:46,607 --> 00:11:51,965
Apparently, he has a quarrel
with Neptune and fears a boat will sink.

140
00:11:52,127 --> 00:11:55,802
- What does he want them for?.
- To auction to the provincials.

141
00:11:55,967 --> 00:11:59,721
He's auctioning everything
at the moment. He has a gift for it.

142
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:03,357
Claudius, what am I doing here?

143
00:12:04,767 --> 00:12:07,076
Why did he choose me for a wife?

144
00:12:08,247 --> 00:12:10,841
I'm ten years older than he is,
not pretty.

145
00:12:11,007 --> 00:12:14,795
I was born the daughter
of a night-watchman, I married a baker.

146
00:12:16,007 --> 00:12:17,998
What does he see in me?

147
00:12:18,167 --> 00:12:21,398
Perhaps that you,
alone among everyone...

148
00:12:22,487 --> 00:12:24,125
truly l-love him.

149
00:12:25,407 --> 00:12:27,318
Yes, I do love him.

150
00:12:29,247 --> 00:12:31,841
I can't explain why.

151
00:12:32,007 --> 00:12:34,396
I know he does terrible things.

152
00:12:39,527 --> 00:12:41,324
I'll tell you something.

153
00:12:41,487 --> 00:12:44,797
He is more afraid than any of us.

154
00:12:50,727 --> 00:12:52,160
Cassius!

155
00:12:53,967 --> 00:12:57,926
I've just been talking to that river god.
He threatened to drown me.

156
00:12:58,087 --> 00:13:00,647
- Does he know who you are?
- He does now.

157
00:13:00,807 --> 00:13:03,719
I've just given him
a severe reprimand.

158
00:13:03,887 --> 00:13:06,355
Well. the river's going down,
isn't it?.

159
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:08,886
Yes, Caesar.

160
00:13:09,047 --> 00:13:12,278
Your uncle is here
with Marcus Vinicius and Asprenas.

161
00:13:13,887 --> 00:13:15,525
Let them in.

162
00:13:21,247 --> 00:13:23,715
Hail Caesar.

163
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:27,357
Lord of the Heavens, the Senate
and the people of...

164
00:13:27,527 --> 00:13:29,358
Where are my carts?

165
00:13:29,527 --> 00:13:31,085
C-carts?

166
00:13:31,247 --> 00:13:33,442
The carts with the valuables
in them.

167
00:13:33,607 --> 00:13:37,725
Oh, heaven bless Your Majesty,
they’re coming by road.

168
00:13:37,887 --> 00:13:42,756
They’ll be a few days. We wanted to
get here quick, so we came by water.

169
00:13:43,927 --> 00:13:46,999
Oh, then back by water you go!

170
00:13:47,767 --> 00:13:50,759
- Throw him in the river!
- Oh, merciful god!

171
00:13:50,927 --> 00:13:53,282
How dare you arrive
without my carts?!

172
00:13:53,447 --> 00:13:55,438
You said they should come by road!

173
00:13:55,607 --> 00:13:58,599
Take him onto the bridge
and throw him off!

174
00:14:01,647 --> 00:14:04,400
Prostrate yourselves
in the presence of Jove!

175
00:14:04,567 --> 00:14:05,886
(SPLASH!)

176
00:14:06,047 --> 00:14:09,278
How dare the Senate send that idiot
to congratulate me!

177
00:14:09,447 --> 00:14:13,838
I'll have their throats cut. He's not worthy.
The man's an imbecile!

178
00:14:18,207 --> 00:14:20,846
I save Rome from a conspiracy

179
00:14:21,007 --> 00:14:24,966
and they send that clapped-out
crippled old clown to felicitate me?

180
00:14:25,127 --> 00:14:29,245
Is that the respect
that they give their Emperor?. !

181
00:14:33,127 --> 00:14:35,163
What's going on there?

182
00:14:36,087 --> 00:14:39,682
More plots, more conspiracies.

183
00:14:40,447 --> 00:14:44,156
I'll set my German guards on them
when I get back.

184
00:14:44,327 --> 00:14:47,239
I'll burn the place down!
It never was any use!

185
00:14:48,967 --> 00:14:51,765
Yes. I should have done that
a long time ago.

186
00:14:51,927 --> 00:14:54,395
I should have had his throat cut
before.

187
00:14:54,567 --> 00:14:57,877
He makes a mess of everything!

188
00:14:58,527 --> 00:15:01,803
He couldn't even order my brothers'
statues on time.

189
00:15:11,967 --> 00:15:16,358
Merciful god, we only came by see
to bring our congratulations sooner.

190
00:15:16,527 --> 00:15:20,202
I wanted carts, not congratulations!

191
00:15:20,767 --> 00:15:23,361
Up! Up! Up! Up! Up!

192
00:15:26,007 --> 00:15:29,204
Did I not tell you that I've had
a quarrel with Neptune?

193
00:15:29,367 --> 00:15:32,643
He plagues me all the time
with his see noises,

194
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:35,719
stirs the river gods up against me
and makes war on me.

195
00:15:35,887 --> 00:15:37,878
How dare you ride with him!

196
00:15:42,527 --> 00:15:44,279
Perhaps...

197
00:15:46,207 --> 00:15:47,959
Yes.

198
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:51,598
Perhaps you plotted with him.

199
00:15:51,767 --> 00:15:53,598
No, merciful god!

200
00:15:53,767 --> 00:15:57,157
Yes, you and that imbecile uncle
of mine plotted with him.

201
00:15:57,327 --> 00:16:00,399
- No, highest one...
- What did you talk about, then?

202
00:16:00,567 --> 00:16:02,444
You and Neptune?

203
00:16:03,047 --> 00:16:05,038
What did you say to one another?.

204
00:16:06,847 --> 00:16:08,997
Nothing, we swear!

205
00:16:09,167 --> 00:16:11,237
Mere mortals can't talk to a god!

206
00:16:11,407 --> 00:16:14,797
Perhaps he appeared to you
in mortal guise as I do.

207
00:16:14,967 --> 00:16:16,878
What did he look like?

208
00:16:18,447 --> 00:16:20,358
We never saw him.

209
00:16:20,527 --> 00:16:24,122
Oh, please believe me.
He wouldn't plot with us.

210
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:29,678
Perhaps you're right.

211
00:16:30,687 --> 00:16:32,996
But I shall kill you just the same.

212
00:16:36,447 --> 00:16:39,166
Down! Cassius, give me your sword.

213
00:16:41,247 --> 00:16:46,526
Oh, please! In the name
of your wife, my sister...

214
00:16:46,687 --> 00:16:50,236
How dare you mention
that whore to me?!

215
00:16:50,407 --> 00:16:52,079
But what have we done?

216
00:16:52,247 --> 00:16:54,761
I'll show the Senate
what I think of their envoys!

217
00:16:54,927 --> 00:16:59,318
I'll send you back in pieces. I wish
I'd done the same with my uncle.

218
00:16:59,487 --> 00:17:01,478
Never mind, they’ll get the message.

219
00:17:01,647 --> 00:17:03,160
No!

220
00:17:04,847 --> 00:17:07,645
(CALIGULA LAUGHS)

221
00:17:09,167 --> 00:17:15,402
And where have you been,
my dear, dear Vulcan?

222
00:17:17,527 --> 00:17:21,520
Oh... "I felt the Thunderer's might,

223
00:17:21,687 --> 00:17:25,885
"Hurled headlong down
from the ethereal height,

224
00:17:26,047 --> 00:17:29,881
"Breathless I fell.
in giddy motions lost.

225
00:17:30,047 --> 00:17:33,437
"The Sinthians raised me
on the Lemnian coast."

226
00:17:33,607 --> 00:17:36,280
For "Lemnian" read "Rhenian".

227
00:17:38,207 --> 00:17:41,916
By Jove! - which is always
to say "by myself" -

228
00:17:42,087 --> 00:17:44,203
this fellow knows his Homer.

229
00:17:44,367 --> 00:17:47,677
Please, Claudius, beseech
the Emperor to save our lives.

230
00:17:47,847 --> 00:17:50,407
"Be silent and obey!

231
00:17:50,967 --> 00:17:55,404
"Dear as you are,

00:17:55,567 --> 00:17:59,480
"I can but grieve,
unable to defend."

233
00:18:01,287 --> 00:18:04,802
Look, if the next two lines are apt,
then they’re saved.

234
00:18:04,967 --> 00:18:07,003
If not, I'll have their throats cut.

235
00:18:27,447 --> 00:18:29,358
Oh, what... Oh!

236
00:18:29,527 --> 00:18:33,122
"What soul so daring
in your aid to move,

237
00:18:33,287 --> 00:18:35,881
"Or lift his arm
against the might of Jove?"

238
00:18:37,127 --> 00:18:39,197
For "Jove" read "C-C..."

239
00:18:39,367 --> 00:18:40,720
Me!

240
00:18:43,407 --> 00:18:45,602
Oh, he's got a line for everything.
Get up.

241
00:18:45,767 --> 00:18:48,998
You're saved by Claudius'
ready tongue.

242
00:18:53,327 --> 00:18:56,285
Come into the other room.
I'll give you a blanket.

243
00:18:58,607 --> 00:19:00,040
Oh, Cassius.

244
00:19:02,807 --> 00:19:05,401
What is the watchword for tonight,
Caesar?.

245
00:19:05,567 --> 00:19:09,242
Oh. The watchword for tonight?.
Let me see.

246
00:19:10,327 --> 00:19:13,478
What about "Give us a kiss"?

247
00:19:31,287 --> 00:19:33,278
It could have been just now.

248
00:19:33,447 --> 00:19:38,202
It could happen tomorrow
or the next day to you or to me.

249
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:42,002
But do not doubt
it will happen one day.

250
00:19:49,767 --> 00:19:53,919
Did that surprise you -
the watchword that I gave to Cassius?

251
00:19:54,087 --> 00:19:57,318
Oh, I t-thought it was a j-j-joke.

252
00:19:57,487 --> 00:20:00,479
It was, but it's my joke, not his.

253
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:03,444
I do it to annoy him.

254
00:20:03,607 --> 00:20:05,996
When he addresses
a commander of the guard,

255
00:20:06,167 --> 00:20:08,237
he has to say "Give us a kiss"!

256
00:20:10,687 --> 00:20:13,406
Yesterday, I gave him
"Touch me, Titus"!

257
00:20:17,567 --> 00:20:22,118
Why, m-may I ask, d-do you do that?.

258
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:25,120
- Because he's a cry-baby.
- Cassius?

259
00:20:25,287 --> 00:20:28,484
I thought he was the b-bravest
soldier in the army.

260
00:20:28,647 --> 00:20:30,877
So did I, but he's not.

261
00:20:31,807 --> 00:20:35,595
I had him torture Gaetulicus to get
some information out of him,

262
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:38,839
and we got no information
and he died under torture,

263
00:20:39,007 --> 00:20:42,966
and one of the guards told me
that Cassius wept.

264
00:20:44,047 --> 00:20:47,722
I was going to give him Macro's
command, but I didn't after that.

265
00:20:51,287 --> 00:20:53,755
How many hours a night do you sleep?

266
00:20:54,927 --> 00:21:00,206
Sleep? Oh, eight or n-nine,
I suppose.

267
00:21:00,367 --> 00:21:02,835
Well. I sleep barely three!

268
00:21:03,007 --> 00:21:06,317
Do g-g-gods need more?

269
00:21:09,647 --> 00:21:11,717
Do you think I'm mad?

270
00:21:13,927 --> 00:21:15,918
M-m-mad?

271
00:21:16,087 --> 00:21:19,636
Yes. Sometimes I think
that I'm going mad. Do you...?

272
00:21:19,807 --> 00:21:23,800
Be honest with me, has that thought
ever crossed your mind?

273
00:21:23,967 --> 00:21:25,286
Never.

274
00:21:26,167 --> 00:21:29,762
N-never.
Why, the idea is preposterous!

275
00:21:29,927 --> 00:21:34,842
You set the standard of s-sanity
for the whole world.

276
00:21:37,167 --> 00:21:40,637
Then why is there all this galloping
in my head?

277
00:21:40,807 --> 00:21:43,480
And why do I sleep so little?

278
00:21:43,647 --> 00:21:47,481
Well. it's your mortal disguise.

279
00:21:48,447 --> 00:21:53,760
You see, a physical body is a great strain
if you're not used to it...

280
00:21:54,887 --> 00:21:57,003
which a god isn't.

281
00:21:57,167 --> 00:22:02,844
Um, err... And that explains too,
I think...

282
00:22:03,607 --> 00:22:05,484
the three hours sleep.

283
00:22:05,647 --> 00:22:08,719
You see, undisguised gods
never sleep at all

284
00:22:10,127 --> 00:22:13,358
Yes, you're probably right.

285
00:22:14,487 --> 00:22:19,163
But if I'm a god, which of course
I am, why didn't I think of that?.

286
00:22:27,047 --> 00:22:30,642
Anyway, whatever the reason,
it's very hard to be a god.

287
00:22:31,407 --> 00:22:34,365
Oh, you do know that I am
that all-powerful god

288
00:22:34,527 --> 00:22:37,485
whose coming the Jews have
prophesied for centuries?

289
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:39,319
Oh, yes, you told me.

290
00:22:39,487 --> 00:22:43,002
I feel very p-privileged
to receive that information -

291
00:22:43,727 --> 00:22:47,356
especially as the Jews, apparently,
don't know it.

292
00:22:47,527 --> 00:22:51,759
But it's prophesied that he'll die
young and hated by his own people.

293
00:22:51,927 --> 00:22:54,646
No, I can't believe that.

294
00:22:54,807 --> 00:22:56,559
Not hated.

295
00:22:56,847 --> 00:23:00,317
It's incredible, isn't it?.
It must be true.

296
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:05,957
Uncle, I want you to come with us
on this expedition.

297
00:23:06,127 --> 00:23:08,766
When we've auctioned
the stuff in the carts...

298
00:23:08,927 --> 00:23:10,838
When they arrive!

299
00:23:12,367 --> 00:23:16,360
We shall cross the Rhine, defeat the Germans
and march towards the sea.

300
00:23:16,527 --> 00:23:19,200
I shall do battle
with my old enemy Neptune,

301
00:23:19,367 --> 00:23:22,359
and what triumphs I shall have
when we return to Rome.

302
00:23:22,527 --> 00:23:24,882
Now leave me. I have a headache.

303
00:23:34,087 --> 00:23:36,681
(FANFARE)

304
00:23:45,207 --> 00:23:47,846
Your Emperor is amongst you
once again.

305
00:23:49,327 --> 00:23:51,795
All his wars successfully concluded

306
00:23:51,967 --> 00:23:55,198
and the victorious armies
brought back to Rome.

307
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:02,525
He had thought,
in his divine innocence...

308
00:24:03,767 --> 00:24:07,476
that the roads might be lined
with cheering crowds.

309
00:24:08,047 --> 00:24:12,006
He had thought that the streets
might be strewn with flowers.

310
00:24:12,167 --> 00:24:16,922
He had thought that messages would
tell him of triumphs to be awarded.

311
00:24:18,927 --> 00:24:20,838
What did he find?

312
00:24:21,607 --> 00:24:25,885
This conqueror of the Germans,
this victor over the mighty Neptune?

313
00:24:27,767 --> 00:24:31,840
The streets empty of crowds
and flowers, no triumphs awarded,

314
00:24:32,007 --> 00:24:34,760
no Games, no celebrations...

315
00:24:35,687 --> 00:24:40,556
but three miserable old ex-Consuls
waiting at the gates to great him

316
00:24:40,727 --> 00:24:44,436
and a room full of cowardly
stay-at-home senators,

317
00:24:44,607 --> 00:24:48,236
who spent all their time
at the theatre and at the baths,

318
00:24:48,407 --> 00:24:50,523
while he has spent six months

319
00:24:50,687 --> 00:24:53,201
living no better
than a private soldier!

320
00:24:55,247 --> 00:24:59,638
Yes, your Emperor has returned...

321
00:25:00,167 --> 00:25:02,681
but with this in his hand!

322
00:25:06,607 --> 00:25:10,361
But, Jove, you ordered no triumphs.

323
00:25:11,327 --> 00:25:14,046
Well. of course I ordered
no triumphs!

324
00:25:14,207 --> 00:25:16,437
Would I order triumphs for myself?.

325
00:25:16,607 --> 00:25:18,723
But you ordered us not to order any.

326
00:25:18,887 --> 00:25:22,641
Yes, and you took me at my word,
didn't you?

327
00:25:23,127 --> 00:25:24,526
Typical!

328
00:25:25,127 --> 00:25:28,324
It didn't occur to you that I might
be leaving it up to you

329
00:25:28,487 --> 00:25:31,957
for your love to show itself freely?.

330
00:25:32,127 --> 00:25:36,803
It didn't occur to you that it might
be my natural humility speaking?

331
00:25:39,927 --> 00:25:44,318
"I ordered you not to celebrate."

332
00:25:46,927 --> 00:25:52,081
But you ordered celebrations
for the anniversary of Actium, didn't you?

333
00:25:53,007 --> 00:25:58,877
Celebrated the defeat
of my great-grandfather Mark Antony!

334

How many bottles of wine did you open
toasting his murder

335
00:26:04,167 --> 00:26:06,522
while I was doing battle
with the sea?

336
00:26:07,567 --> 00:26:09,558
Show them our booty!

337
00:26:10,967 --> 00:26:14,198
Show them the plunder we gathered
from old Neptune.

338
00:26:25,247 --> 00:26:26,965
Sea-shells?

339
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:29,846
Yes. Spoils of the sea.

340
00:26:30,967 --> 00:26:33,162
Loot from old Neptune.

341
00:26:33,327 --> 00:26:36,717
He won't take me on again
in a hurry.

342
00:26:43,047 --> 00:26:45,925
Jove, while you were away,

343
00:26:46,087 --> 00:26:49,557
we built a new temple to you
on Palatine Hill

344
00:26:50,687 --> 00:26:54,396
That won't save you!
Down on your knees, all of you!

345
00:26:54,567 --> 00:26:57,923
Bend your heads. I shall sever
each one at the neck!

346
00:26:58,087 --> 00:26:59,600
Merciful god!

347
00:26:59,767 --> 00:27:03,806
Would you spoil the great day
of your return by spilling blood?

348
00:27:03,967 --> 00:27:06,606
When they write the history
of this day

349
00:27:06,767 --> 00:27:09,964
should they have to mix it
with the death of these fools?

350
00:27:10,127 --> 00:27:12,083
Claudius is right, my Lord.

351
00:27:12,247 --> 00:27:16,001
My husband.
Think of your little daughter.

352
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:19,716
When she is older, she will read
the account of your return.

353
00:27:20,647 --> 00:27:25,801
Must these fools intrude
on such a glorious page of history?.

354
00:27:31,767 --> 00:27:36,204
Your soft words
have appeased my wrath.

As we know, prayer can soften
the hearts of gods.

356
00:27:46,607 --> 00:27:48,245
You may go.

357
00:27:49,527 --> 00:27:52,200
I shall inspect the temple
in the morning.

358
00:27:59,967 --> 00:28:02,640
How right you were, Jove,
to want to punish them

359
00:28:02,807 --> 00:28:04,843
for celebrating
the battle of Actium.

360
00:28:06,047 --> 00:28:09,005
Marcus, I had them both ways.
If they hadn't,

361
00:28:09,167 --> 00:28:13,240
they would have insulted Augustus,
my grandfather, who won the battle.

362
00:28:13,407 --> 00:28:16,365
And Agrippa too,
who was your other grandfather...

363
00:28:18,847 --> 00:28:23,523
Marcus Vinicius,
you are no longer my friend.

364
00:28:26,447 --> 00:28:28,358
What have I said?

365
00:28:28,527 --> 00:28:32,042
You reminded him that Agrippa
was his grandfather.

366
00:28:32,207 --> 00:28:36,041
- But Agrippa was a great man!
- Yes, but of very l-low birth.

367
00:28:36,207 --> 00:28:39,517
Such men do not produce gods,
Marcus.

368
00:28:40,247 --> 00:28:44,923
Certainly not ones capable
of d-defeating Neptune.

369
00:28:51,207 --> 00:28:54,961
If you're no longer his friend,
what can you be but his enemy?.

370
00:28:56,247 --> 00:28:58,158
Go your own way, Cassius.

371
00:28:58,327 --> 00:29:02,286
If we all go our own way, we shall
all end by going the same way.

They could be assassins.

Who are you? What do you want?.

377
00:29:29,327 --> 00:29:32,399
- You're wanted at the palace!
- Is that you, Cassius?

- Yes. Hurry up.

Marcus Vinicius and Asprenas too.

381
00:29:40,567 --> 00:29:43,365
Never mind about dressing.
Throw on a cloak.

382

How long...? How long have we been
sitting here, do you think?

About t-t-two hours.
It must be nearly light.

I don't know. I j-just hope
it's q-quick, that's all

386
00:30:40,847 --> 00:30:43,281
Claudius, I'm sorry
I've made fun of you.

387
00:30:43,447 --> 00:30:48,202
- It doesn't m-matter now.
- Will you give me your hand?

Thank you,

00:38:50,647 --> 00:38:52,239
It's risky.

468
00:38:52,407 --> 00:38:55,524
You can't kill a man
without taking a risk.

469
00:38:55,687 --> 00:38:58,155
But those German guards
never leave him.

470
00:38:58,327 --> 00:39:00,124
There's always a way.

471
00:39:01,087 --> 00:39:04,875
Are you with us? Or will you wait
till he offers you poisoned fruit

472
00:39:05,047 --> 00:39:07,003
or has your throat cut at dinner?.

473
00:39:07,167 --> 00:39:09,442
It's all right for you,
you're a soldier.

474
00:39:09,607 --> 00:39:14,681
Yes. You can leave the killing
to me. But will you help?

475
00:39:18,887 --> 00:39:20,764
He's right, Marcus.

476
00:39:20,927 --> 00:39:24,840
The longer we leave it, the more
certain it is we shan't survive.

477
00:39:26,087 --> 00:39:28,999
All right. But when and where?

478
00:39:30,287 --> 00:39:33,438
Tomorrow is the final day
of the Games.

479
00:39:34,607 --> 00:39:36,598
Let's do it then.

480
00:39:36,767 --> 00:39:38,325
Where?

481
00:39:39,927 --> 00:39:43,715
There's a covered way
at the rear of the Imperial box.

482
00:39:43,887 --> 00:39:46,765
It's an exit you must
persuade him to use.

483
00:39:46,927 --> 00:39:49,236
- How?.
- Find a reason.

484
00:39:49,407 --> 00:39:53,400
Tell him there are crowds out front
and they’ll delay his meal

485
00:39:55,807 --> 00:39:58,196
He'll have his German guards
with him.

486
00:39:58,367 --> 00:40:01,564
Yes. Now, here's the tricky part.

487
00:40:03,127 --> 00:40:05,721
Sabinus and I will be waiting outside.

488
00:40:05,887 --> 00:40:09,038
You'll be in the box with Caligula
and a few friends.

489
00:40:09,207 --> 00:40:11,198
Normally, he would lead the way out,

490
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:14,439
followed by his friends
and then the guards.

491
00:40:16,647 --> 00:40:20,435
The staircase down
to the covered way is narrow.

492
00:40:21,607 --> 00:40:24,519
You must be sure
to be behind Caligula.

493
00:40:25,487 --> 00:40:29,878
As he steps into the covered way,
you must stumble or something -

494
00:40:30,047 --> 00:40:33,005
anything to give us time
to slam the gates

495
00:40:33,167 --> 00:40:35,476
and separate Caligula
from the guards.

496
00:40:35,647 --> 00:40:37,638
That's all you have to do.

497
00:40:43,007 --> 00:40:44,963
And then what?.

498
00:40:46,847 --> 00:40:49,520
We call on the Senate
to declare a Republic

499
00:40:49,687 --> 00:40:51,643
and put an end to this madness.

500
00:40:51,807 --> 00:40:53,877
Who dies with Caligula?

501
00:40:54,047 --> 00:40:56,038
The whole Imperial family.

502
00:40:56,207 --> 00:40:59,882
Caesonia, the child,
the two sisters...

503
00:41:00,847 --> 00:41:03,566
and dear old Uncle Claudius
and his new wife.

504
00:41:07,807 --> 00:41:10,275
- No, I don't want that.
- We must!

505
00:41:10,447 --> 00:41:15,043
Whatever they think of Caligula,
they have to remove his assassins.

506
00:41:15,207 --> 00:41:17,277
None of us would be safe afterwards.

507
00:41:20,447 --> 00:41:24,122
It's Caligula alone or not at all

508
00:41:39,087 --> 00:41:41,840
All right. Just Caligula.

509
00:41:48,927 --> 00:41:51,760
Liberty and the Republic.

510
00:41:55,887 --> 00:41:59,516
I don't like it. It's dangerous
to leave the others alive.

511
00:42:00,167 --> 00:42:03,125
We shan't. I'll see to that,
don't worry.

512
00:42:03,927 --> 00:42:07,556
If they’re in for Caligula,
they’re in for the lot.

They were sent to me by Herod.

He claims they once belonged
to Alexander the G-Great.

525

Really?. I'd no idea
that Alexander played dice.

526
00:42:59,887 --> 00:43:02,879
He had many things in common
with you, Lord.

That doesn't matter.
Your new wife's got plenty. Pay up.

547

I've posted guards at both ends

Oh, Lord, please, regard it
as a small return

560

for the g-great happiness
you've given me with my new wife.

Happiness? She wasn't supposed
to make you happy, nor you her.

- It was meant to be a joke!
- Oh, no, no. You misunderstand me.

No. What I meant was my happiness
comes from contemplating yours.

of s-so much merriment

- Well. nervous. Why is he nervous?

Well. if they’re as good as people
say they are,

00:51:04,647 --> 00:51:06,842
You see, the lads are a bit angry, sir.

620
00:51:07,007 --> 00:51:11,319
No Emperor, no Praetorian Guard,
and it's back to the army for us.

621
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:15,241
I m-must go and f-find my wife.

622
00:51:15,407 --> 00:51:18,160
Of course.
Gratus, go with this gentlemen!

623
00:51:20,607 --> 00:51:22,882
Why can't we have him
for an Emperor?.

624
00:51:23,047 --> 00:51:27,245
Old Claudius?! Don't be stupid, lad.
He's a simpleton. He's...

625
00:51:30,327 --> 00:51:32,887
He's better than nothing.

626
00:51:33,047 --> 00:51:36,562
No, no! I don't want to be Emperor!

627
00:51:36,727 --> 00:51:39,195
I want a Republic!

628
00:51:40,607 --> 00:51:44,361
You a member of the Imperial family,
sir?. Don't make me laugh!

629
00:51:44,527 --> 00:51:47,405
Hay, lads! We've found an Emperor!

630
00:51:48,367 --> 00:51:49,720
No!

631
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:56,560
Das ist eine! Darre Totung!

632
00:51:56,727 --> 00:51:58,445
Wait a minute!

633
00:51:58,607 --> 00:52:02,395
Just a minute, Herman.
That's our new Emperor.

634
00:52:04,647 --> 00:52:06,239
Kaiser!

635
00:52:08,047 --> 00:52:09,844
Emperor!

636
00:52:10,007 --> 00:52:11,406
Ja?

637
00:52:11,567 --> 00:52:13,046
Ja!

638
00:52:14,007 --> 00:52:18,319
Lift him up, lads!
Long live the Emperor Claudius!

639
00:52:18,487 --> 00:52:21,285
No! Put me down! Put me down!

640
00:52:21,447 --> 00:52:25,122
Don't worry, sir, you'll get used
to it. It's not such a bad life.

641
00:52:26,567 --> 00:52:28,239
Put this on him.

642
00:52:29,007 --> 00:52:34,445
Put me down! I don't want to be
an Emperor! I w=want a Republic.

643
00:52:34,607 --> 00:52:38,316
Don't say that in front of the Germans -
they’ll slit your throat.

644
00:52:38,487 --> 00:52:43,515
Come on, smile. Smile.
That's it, that's it. Look happy.

645
00:52:44,687 --> 00:52:46,882
Long live the Emperor!

646
00:52:47,047 --> 00:52:48,844
(ALL) Long live the Emperor!

647
00:52:49,007 --> 00:52:50,838
Long live the Emperor!

648
00:52:51,007 --> 00:52:52,918
Long live the Emperor!

649
00:52:53,087 --> 00:52:55,078
Long live the Emperor!

650
00:52:55,247 --> 00:52:57,078
Long live the Emperor!

651
00:52:57,247 --> 00:52:59,158
Long live the Emperor!

652
00:52:59,327 --> 00:53:01,363
Long live the Emperor!

653
00:53:01,527 --> 00:53:03,404
Long live the Emperor!
