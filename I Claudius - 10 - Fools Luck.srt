1
00:00:57,127 --> 00:01:01,200
I call upon the noble
Appius Junius Silanus to speak.

2
00:01:01,367 --> 00:01:06,566
Senators, I was summoned here
from Spain by our Emperor.

3
00:01:07,487 --> 00:01:09,478
By our late Emperor.

4
00:01:09,647 --> 00:01:11,000
(LAUGHTER)

5
00:01:11,167 --> 00:01:15,240
I need hardly describe to you
the feelings with which I journeyed.

6
00:01:15,407 --> 00:01:19,764
A few months ago, hearing that
a friend was sick, I went to see him.

7
00:01:19,927 --> 00:01:22,646
"What is it that ails you?"
I asked him.

8
00:01:22,807 --> 00:01:26,117
He smiled.
"Appius Silanus," he said,

9
00:01:26,287 --> 00:01:29,006
"I have been summoned to Rome."

10
00:01:30,047 --> 00:01:33,403
He meant, of course,
that he was dying.

11
00:01:35,447 --> 00:01:37,438
I arrived here yesterday.

12
00:01:37,607 --> 00:01:40,326
Today, the Emperor is dead
instead of me.

13
00:01:40,487 --> 00:01:45,641
Let that notorious phrase -
summoned to Rome - perish with him

14
00:01:45,807 --> 00:01:47,923
from our language forever.

15
00:01:48,687 --> 00:01:54,045
And let us return once again
to the sanity of a republic!

16
00:01:54,207 --> 00:01:56,277
(CHEERING)

17
00:02:11,647 --> 00:02:14,684
Senators! Senators! Senators.

18
00:02:14,847 --> 00:02:19,079
The Praetorian Guards have carried off
Caligula's Uncle Claudius

19
00:02:19,247 --> 00:02:21,602
and proclaimed him Emperor.

20
00:02:23,527 --> 00:02:25,040
Did you hear me?

21
00:02:25,207 --> 00:02:29,598
The Guards have proclaimed
Tiberius Claudius Emperor!

22
00:02:37,487 --> 00:02:39,443
Come on, sir. Drink up.

23
00:02:39,847 --> 00:02:42,759
I d-don't want any wine.

24
00:02:46,287 --> 00:02:49,723
Well. do you er...?
Do you mind if I...?

25
00:02:50,887 --> 00:02:52,878
Do as you like.

26
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:56,526
I'm y-your prisoner, not you mine.

27
00:02:56,687 --> 00:03:01,317
No, no, you're not our prisoner.
You're our Emperor.

28
00:03:02,487 --> 00:03:06,799
I've told you a d-dozen times,
I d-don't want to be Emperor.

29
00:03:08,567 --> 00:03:10,444
You're a funny chap.

30
00:03:11,887 --> 00:03:15,766
You're the only person in the country
who doesn't want to be an emperor,

31
00:03:15,927 --> 00:03:18,361
and yet here you are,
chosen to be one.

32
00:03:20,327 --> 00:03:22,522
Life's full of irony, isn't it?.

33
00:03:25,167 --> 00:03:26,759
Hail. Caesar!

34
00:03:26,927 --> 00:03:30,556
I've no right to that title
and you've no business using it!

35
00:03:30,727 --> 00:03:34,720
He's being very awkward. He's been
uncooperative all the way here.

36
00:03:34,887 --> 00:03:36,400
Leave us.

37
00:03:39,927 --> 00:03:45,081
You know, sir, I knew your brother,
the noble Germanicus,

38
00:03:45,247 --> 00:03:47,238
on the Rhine years ago.

39
00:03:47,847 --> 00:03:51,920
We tried to make him Emperor
when Augustus died, but he'd not have it.

40
00:03:52,087 --> 00:03:54,920
Well. my b-brother believed
in a r-republic.

41
00:03:55,087 --> 00:03:58,238
That's all very well
for the likes of you, sir.

42
00:03:58,407 --> 00:04:00,796
Being members
of the Imperial family,

43
00:04:00,967 --> 00:04:05,006
you can afford the luxury
of Republican sentiments. I can't.

44
00:04:05,167 --> 00:04:07,158
I rose through the ranks.

45
00:04:07,327 --> 00:04:10,922
Besides, I've got 4,000 men
who need an Emperor

46
00:04:11,087 --> 00:04:12,998
if they’re to be gainfully employed.

47
00:04:13,167 --> 00:04:15,397
I need not remind you
what might happen

48
00:04:15,567 --> 00:04:17,558
if they’re let loose on the streets.

49
00:04:17,727 --> 00:04:19,479
(KNOCKING)

50
00:04:20,807 --> 00:04:25,722
Excuse me, sir. There's a chap here
who claims to be the King of Bashan.

51
00:04:25,887 --> 00:04:27,878
C-claims to be or is?

52
00:04:28,047 --> 00:04:32,518
Well. I don't know. I didn't know
there was a place called Bashan.

53
00:04:32,687 --> 00:04:35,599
- Do you know him, sir?.
- If it's Herod, of course.

54
00:04:35,767 --> 00:04:37,485
L-let him in.

55
00:04:42,887 --> 00:04:46,323
Congratulations, Caesar,
on your election!

56
00:04:46,487 --> 00:04:51,686
May you long enjoy the honours these
brave soldiers have bestowed on you.

57
00:04:51,847 --> 00:04:55,396
There you are, sir!
And he's the King of Bashan.

58
00:04:55,567 --> 00:04:57,558
You've come at the right moment.

59
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:02,005
Although we've elected him Emperor,
Tiberius Claudius wants a Republic.

60
00:05:02,167 --> 00:05:05,682
Perhaps you can persuade him
to see the consequences.

61
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:11,200
I wish you wouldn't keep
taking it off, sir. It really suits you.

62
00:05:14,767 --> 00:05:16,883
What is the matter with you, Herod?

63
00:05:17,047 --> 00:05:19,686
Do you intend to go along
with this farce?

64
00:05:19,847 --> 00:05:23,283
Listen, old friend, and be thankful
I arrived in Rome.

65
00:05:24,847 --> 00:05:28,476
I know your views, so I know
exactly what you're thinking.

66
00:05:28,647 --> 00:05:32,925
You think of yielding up your power
to the Senate at the earliest moment.

67
00:05:33,087 --> 00:05:34,964
- Of course.
- You mustn't!

68
00:05:35,487 --> 00:05:39,196
First, it would be signal
for civil war.

69
00:05:39,367 --> 00:05:42,882
The Senate are a flock of sheep,
but there are wolves among them,

70
00:05:43,047 --> 00:05:45,402
all convinced
they should be Emperor.

71
00:05:45,567 --> 00:05:50,436
Secondly, the moment you relinquish
your power, you're a dead man.

72
00:05:50,607 --> 00:05:53,405
Why?. I b-believe in a Republic.

73
00:05:53,567 --> 00:05:55,762
You're a danger to the assassins.

74
00:05:56,567 --> 00:05:59,479
They’ve already killed Caesonia
and the child.

75
00:06:00,167 --> 00:06:02,158
- What?.
- Don't you see?

76
00:06:02,327 --> 00:06:05,956
A Republic necessitates the death
of all the Imperial family,

77
00:06:06,127 --> 00:06:08,595
- not just Caligula.
- And M-Messalina?

78
00:06:08,767 --> 00:06:10,519
Oh, she's safe.

79
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:14,362
You must put aside your ancient
prejudices, my friend,

80
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,597
and accept the reality that is.

81
00:06:16,767 --> 00:06:20,043
If you do not, I cannot answer
for the consequences.

82
00:06:20,207 --> 00:06:23,563
These Protectors have been sent
to summon you to the Senate.

83
00:06:23,727 --> 00:06:26,525
- What has happened to them?
- They’re fortunate.

84
00:06:26,687 --> 00:06:28,484
The Guards almost killed them.

85
00:06:28,647 --> 00:06:31,445
Don't you know their persons
are inv-violable?!

86
00:06:31,607 --> 00:06:34,201
Sorry, Caesar. I didn't know
they were coming.

87
00:06:34,367 --> 00:06:36,927
It's a disgrace.
What does the Senate want?.

88
00:06:37,087 --> 00:06:40,841
- Pardon us, Caesar...
- Stop c-calling me that!

89
00:06:41,007 --> 00:06:44,363
The Senate would be obliged
by your immediate attendance.

90
00:06:44,527 --> 00:06:46,961
They’re anxious to know
your intentions.

91
00:06:47,127 --> 00:06:51,245
What, take our Emperor?. Not a chance.
Dump them in the Tiber!

92
00:06:51,407 --> 00:06:53,318
Get back, all of you!

93
00:06:55,807 --> 00:06:59,163
Tell the Senate
that our Emperor remains here.

94
00:07:00,207 --> 00:07:04,086
And when he leaves, he leaves
with 4,000 Guards behind him.

95
00:07:04,767 --> 00:07:07,361
Give my compliments to the Senate.

96
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:12,396
Tell them I am unable, for now,
to comply with their request.

97
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:15,556
Give them safe conduct
back to the city.

98
00:07:16,087 --> 00:07:17,406
Caesar.

99
00:07:18,327 --> 00:07:19,806
Out.

100
00:07:21,447 --> 00:07:23,199
Get a move on.

101
00:07:26,927 --> 00:07:28,997
Do nothing until you hear from me.

102
00:07:30,007 --> 00:07:33,716
I shall arrange a meeting between
you and members of the Senate,

103
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,878
but in the palace.

104
00:07:36,047 --> 00:07:38,356
But make your mind up to it,
Claudius.

105
00:07:38,527 --> 00:07:40,995
For good or ill.
they’ve made you Emperor.

106
00:07:41,167 --> 00:07:45,126
If you don't accept, you won't
survive - or any of your family.

107
00:07:45,887 --> 00:07:52,281
If you do nothing else, accept.
At least for the time being.

108
00:08:06,767 --> 00:08:10,123
(TRUMPET FANFARE)

109
00:08:29,287 --> 00:08:36,363
Senators, I understand you d-d-do
not want another Emperor.

110
00:08:36,527 --> 00:08:40,281
But it seems
you've b-been given one.

111
00:08:41,207 --> 00:08:43,163
I sympathise with you.

112
00:08:43,327 --> 00:08:47,718
I d-do not want to be an Emperor,

113
00:08:47,887 --> 00:08:50,799
but it seems I have been chosen one.

114
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:56,358
Perhaps you could t-take a little
moment to sympathise with me.

115
00:08:57,967 --> 00:09:00,845
Your appointment
is unconstitutional

116
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:06,081
I agree, but there are 4,000
Praetorian Guards who d-do not.

117
00:09:06,247 --> 00:09:09,045
And who created
that Praetorian Guard?

118
00:09:09,927 --> 00:09:12,361
You did in the reign of Augustus.

119
00:09:12,527 --> 00:09:16,998
It's against the constitution.
Only the Senate can appoint an Emperor.

120
00:09:17,167 --> 00:09:21,206
It is also against the constitution
to m-murder one!

121
00:09:21,847 --> 00:09:23,599
If you hadn't done so, Marcus,

122
00:09:23,767 --> 00:09:27,362
we shouldn't b-be here
in this absurd position!

123
00:09:28,007 --> 00:09:30,077
You're not fit to be Emperor.

124
00:09:31,967 --> 00:09:35,926
I agree. But then nor was my nephew.

125
00:09:36,407 --> 00:09:38,523
What difference is there
between you?

126
00:09:38,687 --> 00:09:40,723
He would not have agreed,

127
00:09:40,887 --> 00:09:46,120
and by now your head would be
on that f-floor for saying so!

128
00:09:48,207 --> 00:09:51,279
There are those who say
you cannot hear properly,

129
00:09:51,447 --> 00:09:55,679
you cannot speak properly,
and you've no experience of government.

130
00:09:55,847 --> 00:09:59,203
And that I am, besides,
half w=witted.

131
00:10:08,127 --> 00:10:12,917
Senators, it's true
I am hard of hearing...

132
00:10:14,007 --> 00:10:17,124
but you will find it's not
from want of listening.

133
00:10:18,167 --> 00:10:23,161
As for speaking, again,
it's true I have an impediment.

134
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:28,485
But isn't what a man says
more important than how...

135
00:10:31,447 --> 00:10:34,007
..long he takes to say it?.

136
00:10:36,487 --> 00:10:40,116
It's true, again, I have little
experience of government.

137
00:10:42,087 --> 00:10:43,805
But have you more?

138
00:10:44,927 --> 00:10:48,886
I, at least, have lived with the family
who have ruled this Empire

139
00:10:49,047 --> 00:10:53,837
ever since you so spinelessly
handed it over to us!

140
00:10:54,607 --> 00:10:58,646
I've observed it working
more closely than any of you.

141
00:10:59,607 --> 00:11:02,405
Is your experience better than that?.

142
00:11:04,047 --> 00:11:06,925
As for being half-witted.

143
00:11:08,247 --> 00:11:13,640
Well. what can I say except
that I have survived to middle age

144
00:11:13,807 --> 00:11:19,086
with half my wits, while thousands
have died with all of theirs intact!

145
00:11:19,247 --> 00:11:23,923
Evidently, quality of wits
is more important than quantity.

146
00:11:26,247 --> 00:11:28,397
I shall do nothing unconstitutional

147
00:11:28,567 --> 00:11:30,364
I shall appear at the Senate

148
00:11:30,527 --> 00:11:34,725
where you may confirm me
in my position or not, as you wish.

149
00:11:35,407 --> 00:11:37,477
But if it pleases you not to,

150
00:11:37,647 --> 00:11:41,242
explain your reasons to them,
not to me!

151
00:11:42,407 --> 00:11:46,446
Now you may all leave my house
except Marcus Vinicius and Asprenas.

152
00:11:47,167 --> 00:11:50,239
And bring in Cassius Chaerea
and G-Gaius Sabinus.

153
00:11:58,607 --> 00:12:00,404
I feel a f-fraud.

154
00:12:00,567 --> 00:12:02,797
You won't when you begin work.

155
00:12:02,967 --> 00:12:05,925
There's much to do. Do it very well

156
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:19,485
Caesar, Gaius Sabinus is dead.
He's taken his own life.

157
00:12:19,647 --> 00:12:22,366
All the officers involved
have been arrested

158
00:12:22,527 --> 00:12:24,916
and are awaiting trial
and execution.

159
00:12:31,847 --> 00:12:36,159
I cannot find it in me to condemn you
for killing my nephew.

160
00:12:36,887 --> 00:12:40,323
But you also murdered
the Lady Caesonia and the child,

161
00:12:40,487 --> 00:12:43,240
and you meant to murder me
and my wife.

162
00:12:43,407 --> 00:12:45,841
None of whom had ever done you
any harm.

163
00:12:46,007 --> 00:12:49,044
I did it for the Republic
and I would do it again.

164
00:12:49,407 --> 00:12:55,243
No. You did it more for the injuries
to yourself than for the Republic.

165
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:57,477
But even that doesn't weigh with me.

166
00:12:57,647 --> 00:13:00,241
What w=weighs with me
is w=what I've heard -

167
00:13:00,407 --> 00:13:03,797
that it was agreed among you
that only Caligula should die.

168
00:13:04,607 --> 00:13:09,362
But that you took it upon yourself
to kill us all Is that true?

169
00:13:09,527 --> 00:13:11,085
Why should I deny it?.

170
00:13:11,247 --> 00:13:15,559
Your existence proves that only your
death would have ensured a Republic.

171
00:13:16,327 --> 00:13:19,000
Then you leave me no choice...

172
00:13:19,927 --> 00:13:24,364
b-but to condemn you for the murder
of Caesonia and the child.

173
00:13:26,047 --> 00:13:29,198
- Take him away.
- Congratulations, Caesar.

174
00:13:29,367 --> 00:13:31,358
You've passed your first sentence of death.

175
00:13:31,527 --> 00:13:34,758
How many more will you pass
before they pass one on you?

176
00:13:34,927 --> 00:13:40,559
Isn't that the way we've set for ourselves?
Think about it, Caesar! Think about it!

177
00:13:44,487 --> 00:13:49,561
The investigation into this affair
is closed.

178
00:14:10,287 --> 00:14:16,840
(CROWD SHOUTS)
Hail. Caesar! Hail. Caesar! Hail. Caesar!

179
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:23,558
Oh, look. He's dribbling.

180
00:14:23,727 --> 00:14:26,685
(BABY WAILS)
Oh, chu chu chu.

181
00:14:26,847 --> 00:14:32,205
There's no need to show him
on the balcony every time you see him.

182
00:14:32,367 --> 00:14:35,723
No, but I like to show him.
The people like to see him.

183
00:14:35,887 --> 00:14:39,880
Next to you, he's the most
imp-portant thing in my life.

184
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:42,641
I can't thank you enough for him.

185
00:14:43,727 --> 00:14:46,161
I am so v-very much in love.

186
00:14:47,527 --> 00:14:49,324
And so am I.

187
00:14:53,047 --> 00:14:55,641
I've given him to a foster mother
to nurse.

188
00:14:55,807 --> 00:14:58,241
You're not going
to b-breast feed him?

189
00:14:58,407 --> 00:15:02,082
No, my dear. I've thought
a great deal about it.

190
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:07,558
Now, be honest, have I been a help
to you since you became Emperor?.

191
00:15:07,727 --> 00:15:11,197
Of course. What would I
have done without you? Oh.

192
00:15:11,367 --> 00:15:13,278
What would I have done without her?.

193
00:15:13,447 --> 00:15:16,325
Now, I want no small husbandly
praises.

194
00:15:16,487 --> 00:15:19,923
I asked you to let me revise
the senatorial roll -

195
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:23,602
who should be left on
and who taken off. Was I efficient?.

196
00:15:23,767 --> 00:15:27,999
I was amazed at how much detailed
knowledge you had of everyone.

197
00:15:28,167 --> 00:15:32,718
And all the detailed work I did
as Director of Public Morals?

198
00:15:32,887 --> 00:15:36,675
Yes, it was a revelation.
You've been a great help to me.

199
00:15:36,847 --> 00:15:39,077
As Livia was to Augustus?

200
00:15:40,767 --> 00:15:42,325
Yes.

201
00:15:42,487 --> 00:15:46,685
My darling, I want to be Livia
to your Augustus.

202
00:15:46,847 --> 00:15:49,202
You know I have a brain, as she had.

203
00:15:49,367 --> 00:15:52,598
I'll never be content
just to be the mother of children.

204
00:15:52,767 --> 00:15:54,962
Oh, of course I shall love them.

205
00:15:55,127 --> 00:15:57,436
They’ll be yours - how could I not?.

206
00:15:57,607 --> 00:16:00,201
But I must work alongside you

207
00:16:00,367 --> 00:16:04,963
and relieve you of some
of your small and petty burdens.

208
00:16:05,127 --> 00:16:10,076
Will breast feeding my son interfere
with all this great work of state?

209
00:16:10,247 --> 00:16:13,557
How would you feel if you had
to stop a Senate meeting

210
00:16:13,727 --> 00:16:18,278
to go and breast feed a child -
not once, but four or five times a day?.

211
00:16:18,447 --> 00:16:21,644
Yes. I can hardly find time
to f-feed myself.

212
00:16:23,047 --> 00:16:24,366
Very well

213
00:16:25,207 --> 00:16:28,040
All right. Now I shall leave you
to rest.

214
00:16:28,567 --> 00:16:32,765
And you too should rest.
You've not stopped for a year.

215
00:16:32,927 --> 00:16:34,918
When do I have time to stop?

216
00:16:35,087 --> 00:16:39,239
Well. if you're not going to feed my son,
I'll find you other work.

217
00:16:41,647 --> 00:16:43,478
I told you he wouldn't be angry.

218
00:16:43,647 --> 00:16:47,117
You are fortunate to have
such an understanding husband -

219
00:16:47,287 --> 00:16:49,403
considering that he's also Emperor.

220
00:16:49,567 --> 00:16:52,559
Well. he loves me and I help him.

221
00:16:52,727 --> 00:16:57,278
I don't know why you want to concern
yourself with matters of state.

222
00:16:57,447 --> 00:16:59,438
It's not a woman's place.

223
00:17:00,207 --> 00:17:03,244
It may not be yours, Mother,
but it's mine.

224
00:17:05,447 --> 00:17:08,120
Do you not intend
to have any more children?

225
00:17:08,567 --> 00:17:09,966
No.

226
00:17:10,127 --> 00:17:13,164
- Does your husband realise this?
- Not yet.

227
00:17:13,807 --> 00:17:15,718
How will you prevent it?.

228
00:17:15,887 --> 00:17:18,401
Oh, Mother, you're such a mouse.

229
00:17:19,207 --> 00:17:23,280
Do you think a wife must give in
to her husband every time he insists?

230
00:17:23,447 --> 00:17:25,483
And one of his age?

231
00:17:25,647 --> 00:17:29,845
There are ways of being nice
to a man without risking pregnancy.

232
00:17:31,167 --> 00:17:33,522
Have you never thought
of marrying again?

233
00:17:33,687 --> 00:17:36,121
You're still an attractive woman.

234
00:17:37,207 --> 00:17:38,925
I've thought of it.

235
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:42,235
Why?. Do you want to get rid of me?

236
00:17:45,047 --> 00:17:46,719
Of course not.

237
00:17:46,887 --> 00:17:50,641
On the contrary,
I'd hope that you and any husband

238
00:17:50,807 --> 00:17:53,275
would continue to live
in the new palace.

239
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,915
Well. there's nobody who wants me.

240
00:17:56,647 --> 00:17:58,638
Not even Appius Silanus?

241
00:18:00,967 --> 00:18:02,958
Why did you say that?.

242
00:18:04,687 --> 00:18:06,803
Weren't you fond of him once?

243
00:18:06,967 --> 00:18:12,166
Oh, well.. What a memory you have.
You were so young.

244
00:18:13,047 --> 00:18:15,197
I remember him very well

245
00:18:16,407 --> 00:18:19,046
He used to come to the house
quite often.

246
00:18:20,007 --> 00:18:22,123
That was a long time ago.

247
00:18:23,007 --> 00:18:27,000
Besides, he was at Rome at the time
of Caligula's assassination

248
00:18:27,167 --> 00:18:28,885
but he never came near me.

249
00:18:29,967 --> 00:18:31,958
Perhaps he lacked encouragement.

250
00:18:32,927 --> 00:18:36,966
Well. he went back to Spain
and I've no desire to live there,

251
00:18:37,127 --> 00:18:40,597
so stop making plans
in that busy little head of yours.

252
00:18:43,687 --> 00:18:45,882
So Livia is a goddess at last?.

253
00:18:46,047 --> 00:18:49,483
That will please her.
She wanted that more than anything.

254
00:18:52,087 --> 00:18:55,602
Yes, I've kept my promise,
though I never dreamed I'd be able to.

255
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:59,601
But the Senate f-formally granted
my request this morning.

256
00:18:59,767 --> 00:19:02,361
Livia takes her p-place
among the gods.

257
00:19:04,047 --> 00:19:07,403
I should like to be there in Heaven
when she arrives,

258
00:19:07,567 --> 00:19:12,163
and the Divine Augustus takes her hand
and shows her to all the gods.

259
00:19:13,007 --> 00:19:15,567
Oh, how proud he'll be.

260
00:19:16,047 --> 00:19:18,925
The Lady Messalina
is excessively romantic.

261
00:19:19,087 --> 00:19:24,081
Yes. I'm a l-l-lucky man, am I not?.

262
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:28,198
Shall we tell him?

263
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:31,439
Since he's going away,
let him be the first to know.

264
00:19:31,607 --> 00:19:34,599
- She's pregnant again.
- So soon?

265
00:19:34,767 --> 00:19:37,804
You see, even Herod thinks
it's too soon.

266
00:19:37,967 --> 00:19:40,083
Well. love, it wasn't my fault.

267
00:19:40,247 --> 00:19:42,636
Well. whose fault was it, eh?

268
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:46,925
Well. no... I mean, she gave
our little son out to be nursed.

269
00:19:47,087 --> 00:19:51,239
Well. I understood. She does so much work
for me. It was inconvenient.

270
00:19:51,407 --> 00:19:56,561
But it's well known breast feeding
is a sure guarantee against pregnancy.

271
00:19:56,727 --> 00:19:59,878
- When is it due?
- In July.

272
00:20:00,087 --> 00:20:03,318
I shall send it something
very special indeed.

273
00:20:03,487 --> 00:20:07,924
What will I do without you?
Won't you change your mind and stay?.

274
00:20:08,087 --> 00:20:10,317
No, Caesar,
you don't need me any more.

275
00:20:10,487 --> 00:20:12,955
Who's going to tell me
how to borrow money

276
00:20:13,127 --> 00:20:15,516
or what the corn factors
are saying?

277
00:20:15,687 --> 00:20:19,396
You have good people about you now
who can tell you far more than I.

278
00:20:19,567 --> 00:20:21,637
Messalina, make him change his mind.

279
00:20:21,807 --> 00:20:24,162
He has kingdoms of his own
to govern.

280
00:20:24,327 --> 00:20:27,444
And you've given him several more
than he had before.

281
00:20:27,607 --> 00:20:30,758
Oh, yes. Yes, I mustn't be selfish.

282
00:20:31,567 --> 00:20:35,196
But it's true, all your principal
advisers are freedmen.

283
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:39,485
It would be good to find a nobleman
to take the place of King Herod

284
00:20:39,647 --> 00:20:43,799
- on whom you could absolutely rely.
- Are you thinking of someone?

285
00:20:43,967 --> 00:20:48,324
- Yes, my love.
- You see how she works for me!

286
00:20:48,487 --> 00:20:51,718
Her mind is never still Who?

287
00:20:52,087 --> 00:20:53,805
Appius Silanus.

288
00:20:54,767 --> 00:20:56,678
But he's Governor of Spain.

289
00:20:56,847 --> 00:20:59,077
Yes, and a man
of immense experience.

290
00:20:59,247 --> 00:21:01,317
He's wasted in Spain.

291
00:21:01,487 --> 00:21:05,116
You should bring him to the palace
and have him at your side.

292
00:21:05,287 --> 00:21:08,438
- He has Republican sentiments.
- Well. haven't I?

293
00:21:08,607 --> 00:21:12,395
He spoke out against you
in the Senate after the assassination.

294
00:21:12,567 --> 00:21:16,446
Augustus n-never enquired
into people's political beliefs.

295
00:21:16,607 --> 00:21:19,405
He always said
that was not his concern.

296
00:21:19,567 --> 00:21:21,558
I shall always do the same.

297
00:21:22,087 --> 00:21:26,080
Yes, but I'm not sure Silanus
would like to live in the palace.

298
00:21:26,247 --> 00:21:29,000
The new palace,
which you've turned into offices.

299
00:21:29,167 --> 00:21:33,126
I have a feeling the Lady Messalina
is ahead of us.

300
00:21:33,287 --> 00:21:34,720
What are you thinking?

301
00:21:34,887 --> 00:21:38,596
It's only a suggestion,
but my mother was fond of him once.

302
00:21:38,767 --> 00:21:43,045
It would please her to marry again,
and Silanus would not be adverse

303
00:21:43,207 --> 00:21:45,880
to a connection
with the Emperor's family.

304
00:21:46,047 --> 00:21:49,483
Have you added m-matchmaker
to your list of careers?

305
00:21:49,647 --> 00:21:54,038
- Of course. If you don't approve...
- I was j-joking.

306
00:21:54,207 --> 00:21:58,723
I think it's a very good idea.
What do you think?

307
00:21:59,487 --> 00:22:03,275
As from today, I cease
to give advice on any subject!

308
00:22:05,047 --> 00:22:08,164
Well. I'm tired.
I shall leave you both to talk.

309
00:22:08,967 --> 00:22:11,242
- Goodnight, my dear.
- Have we tired you?

310
00:22:11,407 --> 00:22:14,763
Of course not.
Goodbye, King Herod.

311
00:22:16,167 --> 00:22:18,761
If your people love you
as much as we do,

312
00:22:18,927 --> 00:22:21,361
you are a fortunate king indeed.

313
00:22:21,527 --> 00:22:25,520
I shall be thinking of you in July.

314
00:22:26,767 --> 00:22:28,644
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

315
00:22:33,207 --> 00:22:36,199
Am I not the most f-fortunate
of men, Herod?

316
00:22:36,367 --> 00:22:39,086
Now, why have I deserved such luck?

317
00:22:39,247 --> 00:22:42,205
Oh, it's fool's luck,
little marmoset.

318
00:22:42,367 --> 00:22:44,927
You've always had it
and you always will

319
00:22:45,087 --> 00:22:48,602
One day, I'm sure,
you'll be an Olympian god

320
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:50,758
when I am only a dead king.

321
00:22:52,207 --> 00:22:57,076
You know, when I first came to Rome,
you all seemed like gods to me.

322
00:22:57,247 --> 00:22:59,522
Oh, I'm sure I never
l-looked like one.

323
00:22:59,687 --> 00:23:01,200
Yes, even you.

324
00:23:02,087 --> 00:23:05,318
Do you ever think of those days
at all. little marmoset?.

325
00:23:05,487 --> 00:23:08,638
Lately I've been thinking
about them a good deal

326
00:23:08,807 --> 00:23:10,877
And with a good reason.

327
00:23:12,007 --> 00:23:15,124
I'm thinking of writing a book
about my family.

328
00:23:16,407 --> 00:23:18,204
What sort of book?

329
00:23:22,487 --> 00:23:24,364
T-the truth.

330
00:23:24,527 --> 00:23:26,677
Oh. Will you tell everything?

331
00:23:26,847 --> 00:23:29,236
Everything. As an historian should.

332
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:33,525
Not great tales of heroic exploits
as T-Titus Livy wrote, no,

333
00:23:33,687 --> 00:23:37,157
but the plain facts, the kitchen
details, even the g-gossip.

334
00:23:37,327 --> 00:23:40,239
Why?. Why should you want
to write such a book?

335
00:23:40,407 --> 00:23:42,637
Eh? Why rake it all up?

336
00:23:44,207 --> 00:23:48,598
Because I owe it to the others
to tell the truth.

337
00:23:48,767 --> 00:23:51,520
T-to Postumus and Germanicus.

338
00:23:52,407 --> 00:23:53,806
Why?.

339
00:23:53,967 --> 00:23:56,037
Because they’re dead,

340
00:23:56,207 --> 00:24:00,166
and a man should keep faith with his friends
even though they’re dead.

341
00:24:00,327 --> 00:24:04,366
You see, I've been
so very fortunate in my life,

342
00:24:04,527 --> 00:24:08,361
when they, who were born
more deserving, have not.

343
00:24:08,527 --> 00:24:12,236
I've had only three real friends
in my life.

344
00:24:13,047 --> 00:24:15,561
Postumus and Germanicus were two.

345
00:24:16,647 --> 00:24:18,285
The third one is you.

346
00:24:21,567 --> 00:24:24,206
Listen, Claudius.

347
00:24:26,367 --> 00:24:28,244
Let me give you a piece of advice.

348
00:24:28,407 --> 00:24:31,126
Oh, I thought you'd finished
with advice.

349
00:24:31,287 --> 00:24:33,676
One last piece and then I'm done.

350
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:38,479
Trust no one, my friend, no one.

351
00:24:40,087 --> 00:24:44,763
Not your most grateful freedman,
not your most intimate friend,

352
00:24:44,927 --> 00:24:48,158
not your dearest child,
not the wife of your bosom.

353
00:24:48,847 --> 00:24:50,678
Trust no one.

354
00:24:53,487 --> 00:24:54,966
No one?

355
00:24:56,047 --> 00:24:57,639
Not even you?

356
00:25:06,287 --> 00:25:10,041
- Is it all right?.
- Beautiful. Beautiful.

357
00:25:10,207 --> 00:25:12,357
(BABY CRIES)

358
00:25:13,367 --> 00:25:15,756
Is it a boy or a girl?.

359
00:25:16,287 --> 00:25:19,757
Let us at least
get the engineers to survey it.

360
00:25:19,927 --> 00:25:22,521
We've always w=wanted
a safe winter harbour.

361
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:27,203
Everybody's always said it would
cost too much. Let us find out.

362
00:25:27,367 --> 00:25:29,483
(KNOCKING)
Caesar! The child is born!

363
00:25:30,647 --> 00:25:33,400
- What?.
- Caesar, your child is born.

364
00:25:33,567 --> 00:25:34,920
But...?

365
00:25:36,007 --> 00:25:38,157
The child is born. It's a girl

366
00:25:38,327 --> 00:25:43,117
Oh, Lucina be praised!
She's heard my prayers. I'm coming.

367
00:25:43,287 --> 00:25:45,198
Let's have no more discussion.

368
00:25:45,367 --> 00:25:48,962
Get the engineers to make
that survey. Then we'll decide.

369
00:25:50,287 --> 00:25:53,165
It'll cost ten million. More.

370
00:25:53,327 --> 00:25:57,400
The more expensive it is, the less
likely it is it will ever be built.

371
00:25:58,327 --> 00:26:01,842
What are you suggesting?
That we exaggerate the cost?.

372
00:26:02,007 --> 00:26:05,841
Well. my dear Narcissus, you have
money in corn. I have money in corn.

373
00:26:06,007 --> 00:26:08,123
Lots of people have money in corn.

374
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:13,160
The more corn that can be landed
in winter, the lower the price will be.

375
00:26:13,327 --> 00:26:14,999
That worries me.

376
00:26:16,247 --> 00:26:19,717
That could be construed
as a very selfish point of view.

377
00:26:19,887 --> 00:26:24,722
Is there less selfishness in wanting
the price of corn to be low?.

378
00:26:24,887 --> 00:26:27,481
There are more people
who want it to be low.

379
00:26:27,647 --> 00:26:31,162
Doesn't that add up to more
selfishness rather than less?

380
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:36,720
That is sophistry.
One cannot argue with you.

381
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:38,605
Let's get the report.

382
00:26:38,767 --> 00:26:42,806
I'm sure the cost will take care
of the philosophical considerations.

383
00:27:09,687 --> 00:27:11,006
Oh.

384
00:27:13,247 --> 00:27:15,920
I must have fallen asleep.

385
00:27:16,887 --> 00:27:20,243
You're tired. You don't look well

386
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:22,758
You work too hard.

387
00:27:22,927 --> 00:27:25,566
Yes, but so do you.

388
00:27:26,207 --> 00:27:29,677
You're not so young as I am.
What does your doctor say?.

389
00:27:29,847 --> 00:27:31,997
Oh, what they all say.

390
00:27:32,167 --> 00:27:35,204
I work too many hours.
I should work less.

391
00:27:35,367 --> 00:27:40,282
Well. they’re right. You should
leave more things to other people.

392
00:27:40,447 --> 00:27:45,237
I'm going to see another doctor soon.
G-Greek, recommended by Herod.

393
00:27:45,407 --> 00:27:49,002
Do you think that wise?
Our own doctors are so clever.

394
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:51,886
Well. I'll see him. What can I lose?

395
00:27:52,847 --> 00:27:54,917
How's my l-little daughter?.

396
00:27:55,767 --> 00:27:59,362
Cutting her first tooth.
The nurse showed it to me today.

397
00:27:59,527 --> 00:28:03,679
Ah. Oh, that's painful
Poor little thing.

398
00:28:04,607 --> 00:28:08,282
I think I have the most adorable
husband in the world.

399
00:28:08,767 --> 00:28:11,122
He feels everything so deeply.

400
00:28:11,287 --> 00:28:13,357
You have the m-most adoring.

401
00:28:15,247 --> 00:28:19,877
What did you tell me were the three
main pillars of the temple of love?

402
00:28:20,047 --> 00:28:25,167
Frankness, kindness
and understanding. Why?.

403
00:28:26,207 --> 00:28:30,485
- I want to put them to the test.
- What have you done?

404
00:28:30,647 --> 00:28:32,080
Nothing.

405
00:28:33,047 --> 00:28:37,757
But there's something I want to do
and for which I must be frank.

406
00:28:38,887 --> 00:28:42,197
And for which I must be kind
and understanding?

407
00:28:42,847 --> 00:28:44,280
Well. tell me.

408
00:28:46,287 --> 00:28:50,963
Could you possibly allow me to sleep
in a bedroom of my own for a while?

409
00:28:52,007 --> 00:28:56,239
Oh, don't look like that
or I shall hate myself forever!

410
00:28:56,687 --> 00:28:58,962
Oh, I should never
have suggested it.

411
00:28:59,967 --> 00:29:03,164
D-do you not l-love me any more?

412
00:29:03,927 --> 00:29:07,124
I could understand that.
I am so much older than you.

413
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:11,963
Oh, my dear! I love you more
than I ever did.

414
00:29:12,127 --> 00:29:14,118
Don't you know that?.

415
00:29:14,287 --> 00:29:18,997
I just don't want to risk a third
pregnancy in so short a time.

416
00:29:19,167 --> 00:29:22,045
Don't you see what it could do
to our marriage?

417
00:29:22,207 --> 00:29:24,198
To our love for one another?.

418
00:29:24,367 --> 00:29:28,076
My love, I would never force myself
upon you.

419
00:29:28,887 --> 00:29:31,355
Do we have to sleep apart?.

420
00:29:31,527 --> 00:29:34,325
Couldn't we at least s-share
the same bed?

421
00:29:34,487 --> 00:29:37,843
Don't you see how much more
it would hurt our marriage

422
00:29:38,007 --> 00:29:41,636
if you felt passionate to me
and I felt I had to refuse you?

423
00:29:41,807 --> 00:29:45,641
And if I did not, then how
remorseful you would feel after?.

424
00:29:47,127 --> 00:29:48,924
Oh, I've hurt you.

425
00:29:50,807 --> 00:29:53,879
- I should never have mentioned it.
- No, no, no.

426
00:29:54,567 --> 00:29:55,966
Oh...

427
00:29:57,567 --> 00:30:02,800
How l-long would you want
the s-separation to last?.

428
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:06,243
Oh, not long.
Well. let's see how it goes.

429
00:30:06,407 --> 00:30:09,205
You know I couldn't keep away
from you forever.

430
00:30:10,407 --> 00:30:14,923
I shall slip into your room now
and then when you least expect it.

431
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:18,845
I think that could be even more fun,
don't you?

432
00:30:21,007 --> 00:30:22,406
Pardon me, Caesar,

433
00:30:22,567 --> 00:30:26,446
but you asked me to let you know
when Appius Junius Silanus arrived.

434
00:30:26,607 --> 00:30:28,837
- He is here.
- I'll see him shortly.

435
00:30:29,007 --> 00:30:31,840
No, wait. I'm leaving.
Let him come in.

436
00:30:34,407 --> 00:30:37,001
Well. he's had a long journey.

437
00:30:41,647 --> 00:30:43,444
Very well. my love.

438
00:30:43,607 --> 00:30:47,725
If you think it would be good
for our m-marriage to be apart

439
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:50,082
for a little while.

440
00:30:50,727 --> 00:30:53,639
Women know more about these matters
than men.

441
00:30:53,807 --> 00:30:56,526
I'll have the servants
arrange another bedroom.

442
00:30:56,687 --> 00:30:58,405
There's no need for that.

443
00:30:58,567 --> 00:31:01,559
Since you've agreed
that it's a sensible proposal.

444
00:31:01,727 --> 00:31:04,366
let's do it properly
and remove temptation.

445
00:31:04,527 --> 00:31:08,042
I'll move into a suite
next to my mother in the new palace.

446
00:31:08,207 --> 00:31:12,086
My offices are there too.
It'll be much more convenient.

447
00:31:12,887 --> 00:31:15,799
The noble Appius Junius Silanus,
Caesar.

448
00:31:16,807 --> 00:31:19,275
- Hail. Caesar.
- Did you have a good journey?.

449
00:31:19,447 --> 00:31:21,483
Excellent. The roads were good.

450
00:31:21,647 --> 00:31:24,161
Do you know my wife,
the Lady Messalina?

451
00:31:24,327 --> 00:31:27,637
Only as a girl
You are even more beautiful now.

452
00:31:27,807 --> 00:31:32,244
I'm so glad you're here. You shall
be a great help to my husband.

453
00:31:33,327 --> 00:31:35,397
I'll tell my mother you've arrived.

454
00:31:37,807 --> 00:31:42,676
- Perhaps we can all meat at dinner?.
- I would like to see her again.

455
00:31:46,087 --> 00:31:50,877
Your ayes are inflamed,
but I'll give you a lotion to bathe them with.

456
00:31:51,047 --> 00:31:53,959
Slight retraction of the eyeballs.

457
00:31:54,527 --> 00:31:56,995
- You've had infantile paralysis?
- Yes.

458
00:31:57,167 --> 00:31:59,317
There's nothing I can do about that.

459
00:31:59,927 --> 00:32:02,157
The rest of your body
is fairly sound.

460
00:32:02,327 --> 00:32:05,922
You've developed good strong arms
to compensate for your legs.

461
00:32:06,087 --> 00:32:08,078
- Were you a premature birth?
- Yes.

462
00:32:08,247 --> 00:32:12,843
I thought so. And you've had
measles, colitis, erysipelas.

463
00:32:13,007 --> 00:32:16,716
And scrofula. Can you tell
all that just by looking at me?

464
00:32:16,887 --> 00:32:18,605
And using my brains.

465
00:32:19,567 --> 00:32:22,161
Your food is not digested
from yesterday.

466
00:32:22,327 --> 00:32:26,878
We had a wedding yesterday. Appius
Silanus married my mother-in-law.

467
00:32:27,887 --> 00:32:30,162
I probably ate too much.

468
00:32:30,327 --> 00:32:34,366
You must stop that. Never get up
from a table without wanting more.

469
00:32:34,527 --> 00:32:36,563
- I suppose you get wind?
- Well..

470
00:32:36,727 --> 00:32:40,242
If you do, let it out.
It does great injury to the stomach.

471
00:32:40,407 --> 00:32:42,875
I don't mind which end
you let it out.

472
00:32:43,047 --> 00:32:46,198
A man who puts good manners
before good health is a fool

473
00:32:46,367 --> 00:32:48,881
Is there any point
in prescribing exercise?

474
00:32:49,047 --> 00:32:51,242
No. What time do I get for exercise?

475
00:32:51,407 --> 00:32:53,443
Massage will have to do.

476
00:32:54,047 --> 00:32:55,878
You can get up now.

477
00:32:57,007 --> 00:32:59,965
Now, Caesar, listen.
You work too many hours.

478
00:33:00,127 --> 00:33:04,643
I know that all important people
think they’re indispensable,

479
00:33:04,807 --> 00:33:08,846
but read as little as possible -
get your secretaries to read to you.

480
00:33:09,007 --> 00:33:11,521
Rest for an hour
after your principal meal

481
00:33:11,687 --> 00:33:14,838
Don't go rushing off
to the law courts after dessert.

482
00:33:15,007 --> 00:33:17,760
And have 20 minutes massage
twice a day.

483
00:33:17,927 --> 00:33:20,236
- I've got a good masseur.
- Get rid of him.

484
00:33:20,407 --> 00:33:24,082
The only good masseurs in Rome
are mine. I'll send one to you.

485
00:33:24,247 --> 00:33:26,238
What about the cramps in my stomach?

486
00:33:26,407 --> 00:33:31,242
If you will eat large meals quickly
in a state of nervous excitement,

487
00:33:31,407 --> 00:33:33,238
you must expect cramp.

488
00:33:33,407 --> 00:33:35,398
I'll give you some medicine
for them.

489
00:33:35,567 --> 00:33:38,798
Ah, medicine.
Some secret preparation, I suppose?

490
00:33:38,967 --> 00:33:41,481
Can I get that here
or shall I have to send away?.

491
00:33:41,647 --> 00:33:44,923
You can find it on any piece
of waste ground. It's bryony.

492
00:33:45,087 --> 00:33:46,884
What, common bryony?.

493
00:33:47,047 --> 00:33:49,925
I'll leave instructions
on how to prepare it.

494
00:33:50,087 --> 00:33:52,840
- What about the prayers?
- What prayers?

495
00:33:53,687 --> 00:33:58,317
Don't you prescribe special prayers
to be used when taking medicine?

496
00:33:58,487 --> 00:34:01,923
Caesar, as High Pontiff
and the author of a book on religion,

497
00:34:02,087 --> 00:34:04,999
you are more qualified
to prescribe prayers than I.

498
00:34:05,167 --> 00:34:07,158
Do you Greeks believe in nothing?

499
00:34:07,327 --> 00:34:09,795
I've told you what I believe in -
bryony.

500
00:34:10,407 --> 00:34:11,965
Hail. Caesar.

501
00:34:36,367 --> 00:34:39,120
- You asked to see me?
- Yes.

502
00:34:40,327 --> 00:34:44,559
I too wished to see you. I've not
spoken to you since the wedding.

503
00:34:44,727 --> 00:34:47,958
Which, I understand,
I owe to your good offices.

504
00:34:48,927 --> 00:34:50,246
Yes.

505
00:34:50,407 --> 00:34:54,480
You have done me a kindness
and, I hope, your mother.

506
00:34:55,287 --> 00:34:57,403
Let me speak with you for a moment.

507
00:34:58,047 --> 00:35:00,083
Come and sit beside me.

508
00:35:07,767 --> 00:35:11,965
I love you. I've always loved you,
ever since I was a girl

509
00:35:12,127 --> 00:35:15,597
No. No...don't say anything.

510
00:35:17,327 --> 00:35:20,558
In all the years since you stopped
coming to our house,

511
00:35:20,727 --> 00:35:24,845
I have never once gone to sleep
at night without thinking of you.

512
00:35:25,647 --> 00:35:27,126
Not once.

513
00:35:28,007 --> 00:35:29,884
Can you understand that?.

514
00:35:31,167 --> 00:35:37,242
Not one night have I slept
without thinking of your arms about me.

515
00:35:38,127 --> 00:35:40,721
I've burned inside thinking of you.

516
00:35:41,447 --> 00:35:43,563
And now you're here.

517
00:35:43,727 --> 00:35:45,240
Here.

518
00:35:52,287 --> 00:35:54,357
I don't understand.

519
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:58,884
Oh, my darling. I've arranged
all this to have you near me.

520
00:35:59,047 --> 00:36:01,322
I've dreamed of nothing else.

521
00:36:03,847 --> 00:36:09,797
Then I must tell you that these
are the fantasies of a young girl

522
00:36:10,807 --> 00:36:14,686
They’re the sort of dreams
we put aside when we grow up.

523
00:36:18,727 --> 00:36:21,958
But I have not put them aside,
nor will I.

524
00:36:26,367 --> 00:36:30,406
Am I to understand that my marriage
to your mother -

525
00:36:30,567 --> 00:36:32,842
which you brought me here to...

526
00:36:33,167 --> 00:36:35,044
That was a farce?

527
00:36:35,207 --> 00:36:38,756
It was in order that you and I
could sleep together?.

528
00:36:38,927 --> 00:36:42,237
- My mother is not important.
- And your husband?

529
00:36:42,407 --> 00:36:43,806
Claudius?

530
00:36:43,967 --> 00:36:48,006
Why, do you think I'd arrange
all this without his consent?.

531
00:36:48,167 --> 00:36:50,362
Why do you think we sleep apart?.

532
00:36:50,927 --> 00:36:53,316
Those are his arrangements,
not mine.

533
00:36:53,487 --> 00:36:58,277
Not that I mind. His sexual
practices are abhorrent to me.

534
00:36:58,447 --> 00:37:01,166
Why has he agreed
to your sleeping apart?.

535
00:37:01,327 --> 00:37:05,366
Because he now wishes to practise them
with the wives of Senators.

536
00:37:05,527 --> 00:37:10,282
He wants me kept amused while he does,
and he expects you to do it.

537
00:37:10,447 --> 00:37:12,677
That's why you're here.

538
00:37:14,367 --> 00:37:16,483
Then let him tell me that himself!

539
00:37:16,647 --> 00:37:18,717
Oh, you simpleton!

540
00:37:18,887 --> 00:37:21,276
Do you think he would
tell you himself?.

541
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:24,359
He'll deny it, of course he will

542
00:37:26,567 --> 00:37:28,637
You disappoint me.

543
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:31,483
I thought you more sophisticated

544
00:37:31,647 --> 00:37:34,764
than to confront him with
an arrangement he agrees to,

545
00:37:34,927 --> 00:37:36,997
but would proffer not to discuss.

546
00:37:37,167 --> 00:37:40,239
Are you all so brutally obvious
in Spain?

547
00:37:42,367 --> 00:37:45,996
Everything is arranged, my darling.

548
00:37:46,767 --> 00:37:49,600
You're right. I am a simpleton!

549
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:53,125
Having lived through the reigns
of three Caesars,

550
00:37:53,287 --> 00:37:56,916
and seen the depths to which Rome
has sunk beneath them,

551
00:37:57,087 --> 00:38:01,126
I should have known better than to
believe a fourth could be different.

552
00:38:02,607 --> 00:38:05,758
I have a granddaughter
nearly your age.

553
00:38:09,527 --> 00:38:13,566
I won't deny that
I'm of an amorous disposition -

554
00:38:13,727 --> 00:38:15,524
I have been all my life.

555
00:38:16,047 --> 00:38:19,244
But I wouldn't touch you, Lady,
for all your beauty...

556
00:38:19,407 --> 00:38:22,205
with a ten-foot pole!

557
00:38:27,607 --> 00:38:29,677
You forget who I am!

558
00:38:29,847 --> 00:38:35,126
Not the girl you once teased
and joked with, but the Emperor's wife!

559
00:38:38,727 --> 00:38:42,163
I have only to raise my voice
and tear my clothes

560
00:38:42,327 --> 00:38:44,966
for you to be executed on the spot!

561
00:38:47,167 --> 00:38:52,480
I give you one weak to come to me
of your own accord and on your knees!

562
00:38:52,847 --> 00:38:58,205
If you do not, I shall tell
my husband that you refused me...

563
00:38:59,047 --> 00:39:04,041
and in refusing his wife,
you will have insulted him.

564
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:07,481
He's become very vain, you know.

565
00:39:07,647 --> 00:39:09,842
You're wasting your time, Lady.

566
00:39:10,567 --> 00:39:15,516
I've lived too long to become
the bedtime toy of a 17-year-old girl

567
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:17,643
Your threats are wasted on me.

568
00:39:18,607 --> 00:39:21,485
- We shall see.
- Yes, we shall see.

569
00:39:21,647 --> 00:39:25,356
And Rome shall see how easy it is
to straighten one's back

570
00:39:25,527 --> 00:39:28,724
and hold one's head high
when the will is there.

571
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:38,318
Well. w=what is it?.

572
00:39:40,447 --> 00:39:42,881
A plan for rebuilding the harbour
at Ostia.

573
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:46,005
Of course it is! Whose is it?.

574
00:39:52,887 --> 00:39:55,447
It was made in the time
of the Divine Julius.

575
00:39:55,607 --> 00:39:58,724
- Where did you find it, Caesar?.
- In the archives.

576
00:39:58,887 --> 00:40:03,563
It's identical to the one Tortius
has just produced. Look, Silanus.

577
00:40:06,527 --> 00:40:09,041
What's the matter with you?
Are you ill?.

578
00:40:09,207 --> 00:40:12,836
- No, Caesar.
- What relevance have these plans?

579
00:40:13,007 --> 00:40:17,080
Well. the engineers working
under the D-Divine Julius

580
00:40:17,247 --> 00:40:20,000
estimated this rebuilding
would take four years

581
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:22,283
and cost four million gold pieces.

582
00:40:22,447 --> 00:40:26,156
The estimates presented to me
are for t-ten years

583
00:40:26,327 --> 00:40:28,795
and 15 million gold pieces.

584
00:40:31,487 --> 00:40:34,126
But those estimates
are 90 years old.

585
00:40:34,287 --> 00:40:37,962
Are there less days in a year now
than there were then?

586
00:40:38,127 --> 00:40:40,197
There's been an increase in costs.

587
00:40:40,367 --> 00:40:43,120
Prices have risen
by no more than a quarter.

588
00:40:43,287 --> 00:40:46,802
How, then, do you explain
my chief engineer's estimate?

589
00:40:49,527 --> 00:40:51,643
- Well..
- I will explain.

590
00:40:51,807 --> 00:40:55,004
Everywhere you underestimate
the amount of earth

591
00:40:55,167 --> 00:40:57,397
that one hundred men
can move in a day.

592
00:40:57,567 --> 00:41:00,525
I mean, are men weaker now
than they were then?

593
00:41:00,687 --> 00:41:02,678
The topography remains unchanged,

594
00:41:02,847 --> 00:41:06,886
yet on the Divine Julius' plan
they were cutting through earth.

595
00:41:07,407 --> 00:41:12,083
In yours, you claim we were
cutting through r-r-rock.

596
00:41:14,647 --> 00:41:17,719
- I can't understand it.
- Let me explain it.

597
00:41:17,887 --> 00:41:21,675
Your surveyors have been taking
bribes from the corn factors.

598
00:41:21,847 --> 00:41:25,317
- Caesar!
- Sh-sh-shocking, isn't it?.

599
00:41:25,487 --> 00:41:28,399
Well. I-I can't think
why they should.

600
00:41:28,567 --> 00:41:31,798
I can. To keep up the price of corn.

601
00:41:32,527 --> 00:41:34,483
Wouldn't you agree, Silanus?

602
00:41:35,127 --> 00:41:36,606
Yes, Caesar.

603
00:41:37,567 --> 00:41:41,560
Well. Tortius. You will begin work
on the basis of these estimates,

604
00:41:41,727 --> 00:41:44,321
revised for the difference
in prices.

605
00:41:44,487 --> 00:41:47,365
Even so, Caesar, where is the money
to come from?

606
00:41:47,527 --> 00:41:51,122
We shall get the first million
on loan from the corn factors.

607
00:41:51,287 --> 00:41:53,642
A million?
They can't raise that much.

608
00:41:53,807 --> 00:41:56,560
You'll be amazed, Pallas,
at what they can raise

609
00:41:56,727 --> 00:41:59,560
in return for my agreement
not to begin an inquiry

610
00:41:59,727 --> 00:42:03,242
into allegations of b-bribing
my officials.

611
00:42:04,007 --> 00:42:06,237
Yes. It's very late. You may all go.

612
00:42:08,207 --> 00:42:10,767
We'll visit the harbour tomorrow.

613
00:42:20,927 --> 00:42:23,646
I should like a word with you alone,
Caesar.

614
00:42:23,807 --> 00:42:27,004
Oh, very well Come and look
at these plans, Silanus.

615
00:42:27,167 --> 00:42:29,203
You didn't take much notice of them.

616
00:42:29,367 --> 00:42:32,086
The Divine Julius
knew what he was about.

617
00:42:32,247 --> 00:42:34,238
Yes. They are remarkable.

618
00:42:34,407 --> 00:42:37,922
In many ways, better than the ones
T-Tortius has produced.

619
00:42:38,087 --> 00:42:39,964
The only thing they leave out

620
00:42:40,127 --> 00:42:44,006
is the building of the island
between the two moles.

621
00:42:44,167 --> 00:42:45,646
Come and look...

622
00:42:47,087 --> 00:42:49,282
Help! Get off me!

623
00:42:49,447 --> 00:42:51,005
Help me!

624
00:42:51,167 --> 00:42:53,727
Help me! Help me! Help me!

625
00:43:00,007 --> 00:43:01,838
Wait! Wait!

626
00:43:03,407 --> 00:43:05,875
Get up! Get up!

627
00:43:06,047 --> 00:43:09,039
What happened? Caesar! You're hurt!

628
00:43:09,207 --> 00:43:13,120
- I'll fetch the doctor.
- Silanus tried to kill me.

629
00:43:13,287 --> 00:43:15,721
Why?. Why?.

630
00:43:15,887 --> 00:43:18,117
Let me have him, Caesar. He'll talk.

631
00:43:18,287 --> 00:43:20,482
Why, Silanus, why?.

632
00:43:20,647 --> 00:43:22,126
Tyrant!

633
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:27,683
Tyrant?. I don't understand.
What harm have I ever done you?

634
00:43:28,647 --> 00:43:32,560
I brought you back from Spain,
I made you a minister.

635
00:43:32,727 --> 00:43:35,366
I connected you by marriage
with my family.

636
00:43:35,527 --> 00:43:40,078
Yes! To put me in bed with your wife
and service her like a bull!

637
00:43:47,167 --> 00:43:49,317
What do you mean?

638
00:43:52,927 --> 00:43:57,284
- W-what do you mean?
- You're all the same.

639
00:43:57,447 --> 00:44:00,439
Don't toy with me, Caesar.
Do what you have to do.

640
00:44:00,607 --> 00:44:04,486
I ask you again, w=what do you mean?

641
00:44:04,647 --> 00:44:06,638
You know what I mean!

642
00:44:07,527 --> 00:44:10,087
How predictable you Emperors are.

643
00:44:10,247 --> 00:44:12,715
All your reigns
begin and end the same.

644
00:44:12,887 --> 00:44:17,039
From vices timidly concealed
to vices openly displayed.

645
00:44:17,207 --> 00:44:20,756
One follows the other
as sure as decay follows death.

646
00:44:20,927 --> 00:44:23,521
Fetch the Lady M-Messalina,
and her mother!

647
00:44:23,687 --> 00:44:28,238
We've seen this play before,
don't make us sit through it till the end.

648
00:44:28,407 --> 00:44:32,116
You will explain that calumny
on my wife and on her mother.

649
00:44:32,287 --> 00:44:35,359
And if you do not or will not
to my satisfaction,

650
00:44:35,527 --> 00:44:39,236
you will surely die
for this attempt on my life!

651
00:44:39,407 --> 00:44:41,398
What is it?. What's the matter?.

652
00:44:41,567 --> 00:44:44,718
Appius Silanus has tried
to kill the Emperor.

653
00:44:45,247 --> 00:44:49,365
Silanus? But why?.
Why would he do such a thing?

654
00:44:49,527 --> 00:44:53,042
I don't know. I thought perhaps
you could tell me.

655
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:03,757
What have you done?
What do you know about this?

656
00:45:09,127 --> 00:45:13,279
I know nothing. Nothing! Do you
think I plot to kill my own husband?

657
00:45:13,447 --> 00:45:15,642
There's no time to discuss it now.

658
00:45:15,807 --> 00:45:19,243
You must support everything I say,
do you understand?

659
00:45:19,407 --> 00:45:20,760
Mother!

660
00:45:20,927 --> 00:45:24,476
I will do nothing to incriminate
Silanus. He's my husband.

661
00:45:24,647 --> 00:45:28,481
Oh, you fool! Do you think I brought
him back from Spain for you?!

662
00:45:28,647 --> 00:45:31,036
I love him. I've always loved him.

663
00:45:31,567 --> 00:45:33,444
You are monstrous!

664
00:45:33,607 --> 00:45:34,960
(KNOCKING)

665
00:45:40,087 --> 00:45:43,841
You will tell my husband
what I tell him, understand?

666
00:45:44,767 --> 00:45:48,282
If you do not, I shall say
you were part of it all

667
00:45:48,807 --> 00:45:51,196
I'll say you agreed to it.

668
00:46:01,207 --> 00:46:04,597
Oh, my dear. What's happened?
Are you all right?.

669
00:46:04,767 --> 00:46:07,156
Yes, yes. I'm all right.

670
00:46:07,327 --> 00:46:10,683
Silanus tried to assassinate me,
but I'm all right.

671
00:46:11,127 --> 00:46:13,561
I want you to look at him.

672
00:46:17,007 --> 00:46:19,567
I want you to look into his face.

673
00:46:20,487 --> 00:46:24,196
Now, repeat to her
what you said to me.

674
00:46:24,367 --> 00:46:26,756
Let's finish with this. Get it over.

675
00:46:26,927 --> 00:46:29,043
- Repeat it.
- For whom?

676
00:46:29,207 --> 00:46:31,437
For her, who told me
what I told you?

677
00:46:31,607 --> 00:46:34,519
- Or for you, who knew it all?.
- Repeat it!

678
00:46:35,927 --> 00:46:38,316
I told your husband
what you told me.

679
00:46:38,487 --> 00:46:42,560
That he had arranged my marriage
so that you could become my mistress.

680
00:46:42,727 --> 00:46:45,560
That he had done it
so you could be kept amused

681
00:46:45,727 --> 00:46:49,003
while he took his own perverted
pleasures elsewhere.

682
00:46:49,167 --> 00:46:51,806
It was there and then
that I decided to kill him.

683
00:46:51,967 --> 00:46:55,676
To strike a last blow for Rome
and end this plague of Emperors!

684
00:46:58,287 --> 00:46:59,640
Well?.

685
00:47:04,487 --> 00:47:06,398
Oh, Silanus...

686
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:09,125
How could you?

687
00:47:10,807 --> 00:47:12,479
How could you?

688
00:47:19,287 --> 00:47:22,245
He is sick with love, my dear,
for me.

689
00:47:22,607 --> 00:47:25,280
I should have told you.

690
00:47:25,447 --> 00:47:29,520
I should have come to you at once
but I thought it would pass.

691
00:47:32,367 --> 00:47:36,326
Apparently, he has loved me
ever since I was a little girl

692
00:47:36,487 --> 00:47:39,047
I had no idea. How could I?

693
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:45,237
Since he returned,
he has pestered me day and night.

694
00:47:46,327 --> 00:47:50,639
Sometimes pleading
and sometimes angry and violent.

695
00:47:52,407 --> 00:47:56,195
I think, perhaps, in his mind,

696
00:47:56,367 --> 00:47:59,484
he does in some way
believe what he told you.

697
00:48:00,607 --> 00:48:03,997
That I had arranged his marriage
for our convenience.

698
00:48:14,087 --> 00:48:17,238
You poor deluded man.

699
00:48:19,367 --> 00:48:23,201
How could you think there was anyone
dearer to me than my husband?

700
00:48:26,007 --> 00:48:29,556
When he came to me today,
he was so violent

701
00:48:29,727 --> 00:48:33,242
that I said I would come to you
and have you send him away.

702
00:48:33,407 --> 00:48:35,921
That's when he threatened
to kill you!

703
00:48:36,087 --> 00:48:40,558
I never in my wildest dreams imagined
he would carry out such a threat!

704
00:48:40,727 --> 00:48:43,116
Bravo! Beautifully played!

705
00:48:43,287 --> 00:48:46,404
That performance should be enshrined
in drama.

706
00:48:51,167 --> 00:48:53,123
Is this t-true?

707
00:48:57,447 --> 00:49:02,237
Yes. His passion for my daughter
has turned his wits.

708
00:49:07,767 --> 00:49:10,042
Have you anything to say?.

709
00:49:11,527 --> 00:49:14,564
Only that what I did I'd do again.

710
00:49:14,727 --> 00:49:17,161
Then you leave me no choice!

711
00:49:17,327 --> 00:49:19,522
No! Oh, no!

712
00:49:19,687 --> 00:49:22,884
Please, my dearest, I beg you!

713
00:49:23,047 --> 00:49:26,926
I couldn't bear for him to die
because of his love for me.

714
00:49:27,087 --> 00:49:31,842
No, no. Banish him. Banish him.
But let him live.

715
00:49:32,007 --> 00:49:34,441
(PALLAS) He must die, Caesar.

716
00:49:34,607 --> 00:49:37,280
No! NO!!

717
00:49:39,007 --> 00:49:43,000
An attempted assassination
cannot be punished with banishment.

718
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:46,557
Such a precedent would serve
only to encourage others.

719
00:49:46,727 --> 00:49:49,082
What a soft heart you have.

720
00:49:50,287 --> 00:49:53,518
Even after all the lies
he's told about you.

721
00:49:54,487 --> 00:49:56,478
But P-Pallas is right.

722
00:49:56,647 --> 00:50:00,196
The heart cannot rule the head
in these matters.

723
00:50:00,727 --> 00:50:04,686
I cannot do it, even for you.

724
00:50:13,527 --> 00:50:17,805
I sentence you to die,
as you sentenced me.

725
00:50:19,047 --> 00:50:21,925
- Take him away.
- May you rot in hell!

726
00:50:22,407 --> 00:50:24,841
And that she-wolf with you!

727
00:50:25,527 --> 00:50:28,200
Now, leave me, all of you.

728
00:50:30,367 --> 00:50:31,925
I'm tired.

Vtg
