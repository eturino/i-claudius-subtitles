Ah, where did you find this one?

Under a pile of old rubbish in the cellar.
I doubt we'll find any more.

some of this mess, Caesar?.

No! The last time you tidied up
I couldn't find anything any more.

was terrible when we came on it.

No one had been buried. Bodies
strewn around, horribly mutilated.

Tell me about Postumus.
You didn't say much in your letters.

53
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:07,276
I was afraid to say too much.

54
00:05:07,447 --> 00:05:11,759
Letters get intercepted and read
by certain parties.

Come, you see plots everywhere.
Who would dare to open your mail?.

- Livia?!
- Sh!

58
00:05:24,327 --> 00:05:27,160
How else do you think
she knows everything?

59
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,080
Does Augustus know that she does that?.

60
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:34,684
I don't know what Augustus knows,
but she knows everything.

61

- Postumus thinks...
- Thinks what?.

62
00:05:45,767 --> 00:05:49,885
That night he was arrested, he broke
away and came to see me in my room.

63
00:05:50,047 --> 00:05:52,197
He wasn't trying to escape,

64
00:05:52,367 --> 00:05:55,484
but he wanted me to know the truth
so I could tell you.

65
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:57,478
What did he tell you?

66
00:05:57,647 --> 00:06:02,641
That he didn't force Livilla.
She invited him into her room -

67
00:06:02,807 --> 00:06:06,516
as she'd often done before
when Castor was out gambling or...

68
00:06:06,687 --> 00:06:09,804
Anyway, when he got there,
she started to scream.

69
00:06:09,967 --> 00:06:14,006
The guards rushed in and she accused
him of trying to r-rape her.

70
00:06:15,367 --> 00:06:18,404
- Did you believe him?
- Yes.

71
00:06:18,567 --> 00:06:21,923
I'd believe Postumus
before I'd believe Livilla.

72
00:06:22,087 --> 00:06:26,205
But, Claudius, it's an age-old
excuse that men have often used.

73
00:06:26,367 --> 00:06:28,198
"She led me on. She wanted me to."

74
00:06:28,367 --> 00:06:33,077
I've thought of that too. One does,
even about one's friends.

75
00:06:33,247 --> 00:06:35,203
But I believe him.

76
00:06:35,367 --> 00:06:39,360
- But why would she do such a thing?
- I asked him the same thing.

77
00:06:39,527 --> 00:06:41,165
He said...

78
00:06:45,887 --> 00:06:48,355
L-Livia had put her up to it.

79
00:06:48,527 --> 00:06:50,722

00:06:55,967 --> 00:06:59,403
If you'll listen, I'll tell you
what Postumus thinks of her.

83
00:06:59,567 --> 00:07:02,445
It will stand the hairs up
on your head.

84
00:07:08,847 --> 00:07:12,886
He believes that she has
systematically destroyed his mother,

85
00:07:13,047 --> 00:07:15,163
his brothers
and possibly his father,

86
00:07:15,327 --> 00:07:18,046
that she poisoned
Julia's first husband

87
00:07:18,207 --> 00:07:20,801
and had a hand
in our father's death.

88
00:07:20,967 --> 00:07:23,800
He believes that she poisoned
our grandfather,

89
00:07:23,967 --> 00:07:27,755
and she will stop at nothing
to ensure Tiberius follows Augustus.

90
00:07:27,927 --> 00:07:29,918
He believes she's mad.

And I said all that without
s-s-stuttering.

- Proof?.
- No.

94
00:07:44,807 --> 00:07:47,640
Claudius, have you mentioned this
to Augustus?

95
00:07:47,807 --> 00:07:51,766
No! He takes me
for a big enough fool already.

96
00:07:51,927 --> 00:07:54,043
It must come from you or no one.

97
00:07:56,447 --> 00:08:00,725
- All right. I'm listening.
- Not here.

00:11:32,887 --> 00:11:36,357
You'd tell him I forced you
and shed a few tears.

157
00:11:36,527 --> 00:11:38,722
I never met a man
who could resist that.

158
00:11:38,887 --> 00:11:42,960
If he knows something,
it wasn't from me. I swear it.

159
00:11:43,687 --> 00:11:45,484
I swear it!

160
00:11:49,727 --> 00:11:51,160
All right.

161
00:11:54,007 --> 00:11:55,599
I believe you.

162
00:12:00,327 --> 00:12:02,204
Someone else, then.

163
00:12:04,527 --> 00:12:07,837
Castor knows.
He guessed. I never told him.

164
00:12:08,007 --> 00:12:11,283
Yes, Castor knows. That's why
you got your black aye.

165
00:12:11,447 --> 00:12:13,438
It didn't pass unnoticed, my dear.

166
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:17,646
If Castor knows, he'd keep it
to himself. He's got nothing to gain.

167
00:12:17,807 --> 00:12:20,685
- It's someone else.
- My brother?.

168
00:12:20,847 --> 00:12:23,520
- Germanicus wasn't here.
- I meant Claudius.

169
00:12:24,647 --> 00:12:28,765
That fool?. His brains are addled.
He sees nothing and he hears nothing.

170
00:12:30,767 --> 00:12:34,396
Well. perhaps I was wrong.

171
00:12:36,167 --> 00:12:39,239
Perhaps we should just wait and see.

172
00:12:43,807 --> 00:12:46,401
(SOUND OF WAVES CRASHING)

173
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:07,716
Well. well. well..

174
00:13:08,847 --> 00:13:12,157
What have we here? Tourists?

175
00:13:13,647 --> 00:13:16,400
Have you come to see the beast
in his cage?

176
00:13:16,567 --> 00:13:19,081
Is the rock bare enough for you,
Father?.

177
00:13:19,247 --> 00:13:23,320
Does it conform to your notions
of smallness?

178
00:13:23,487 --> 00:13:26,684
How thin you look. How pale.

179
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:31,159
What did you expect?.
A fat, jolly man full of laughs and jokes?

180
00:13:36,927 --> 00:13:38,963
You must forgive me, Father.

181
00:13:39,127 --> 00:13:42,483
It's been four years since I saw
a soul apart from the guards.

182
00:13:42,647 --> 00:13:44,638
I wasn't prepared for visitors.

183
00:13:44,807 --> 00:13:47,640
This is Quintus Fabius Maximus,
an old friend.

184
00:13:47,807 --> 00:13:50,275
I envy you, Quintus Fabius Maximus.

185
00:13:50,447 --> 00:13:52,244
Envy me what?.

186
00:13:52,407 --> 00:13:55,285
That you're an old friend
of my father's.

187
00:13:55,447 --> 00:13:57,802
You're better off
than his adopted son.

188
00:13:58,807 --> 00:14:00,399
Leave us.

189
00:14:09,607 --> 00:14:11,757
They never told me
it'd be like this.

190
00:14:11,927 --> 00:14:14,043
I don't expect you ever asked!

191
00:14:14,207 --> 00:14:17,085
You don't find out
what you don't want to know!

192
00:14:17,247 --> 00:14:20,125
- Don't say that.
- Did you come for a tour?.

193
00:14:20,287 --> 00:14:23,484
That'll take ten minutes,
as you once prophesied!

194
00:14:23,647 --> 00:14:26,559
Then wound me if you must.
I deserve it.

195
00:14:26,727 --> 00:14:30,003
You have a knife. I wouldn't
blame you if you used it!

196
00:14:33,287 --> 00:14:35,278
Oh, it's tears now, is it?.

197
00:14:35,447 --> 00:14:39,042
I never knew a man
cry as easily as you do.

198
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:45,237
Yes, tears come easily to me.
I don't deny it.

199
00:14:45,407 --> 00:14:47,398
You're wonderful. wonderful!

200
00:14:47,567 --> 00:14:50,400
What's my role now?.
To feel sorry for you?!

201
00:14:50,567 --> 00:14:53,001
- Mistakes have been made...
- Mistakes!

202
00:14:53,167 --> 00:14:56,876
Is that what you call them?
You think tears will put them right?.

203
00:14:57,047 --> 00:14:59,959
Well. bravo!
You still have tears to shed.

204
00:15:00,127 --> 00:15:03,836
How many tears would you have left
if you'd sat on this rock

205
00:15:04,007 --> 00:15:05,998
for four solid years?

206
00:15:06,167 --> 00:15:07,725
- Postumus...
- How many?. !

207
00:15:07,887 --> 00:15:10,765
You've come to the wrong place
to show your tears.

208
00:15:10,927 --> 00:15:12,918
Even the stones weep here.

209
00:15:14,927 --> 00:15:17,805
Now you've heard something,
is that it?.

210
00:15:17,967 --> 00:15:21,118
It's made you think,
perhaps you were wrong, too hasty?.

211
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:24,085
Is that why you're here,
to tell me it was a mistake?

212
00:15:24,247 --> 00:15:26,715
I don't want to hear it!
Leave me alone!

213
00:15:26,887 --> 00:15:29,117
Go away and die but leave me alone!

214
00:15:40,927 --> 00:15:42,360
Postumus...

215
00:15:42,527 --> 00:15:44,597
What have you done to me?

216
00:15:44,767 --> 00:15:48,885
Four years!
What have you done with my life?

217
00:15:49,047 --> 00:15:51,038
Don't. Please don't...

218
00:15:52,367 --> 00:15:55,325
When those guards came in,
I thought, "This is the end.

219
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:58,524
"He's sent them now
to finish me off."

220
00:15:58,687 --> 00:16:02,521
- How could you think such a thing?
- What else could I think?

221
00:16:02,687 --> 00:16:04,678
To die, that's nothing.

222
00:16:04,847 --> 00:16:10,240
I'd have given my life for you,
for Rome, a thousand times over.

223
00:16:10,407 --> 00:16:12,318
But to die like a dog...

224
00:16:17,687 --> 00:16:20,838
What can I say?. What can I say?.

225
00:16:23,647 --> 00:16:26,798
A day hasn't passed
when I haven't thought of you.

226
00:16:26,967 --> 00:16:28,764
And I of you.

227
00:16:29,607 --> 00:16:32,246
But not fondly, Father, not fondly.

228
00:16:32,407 --> 00:16:34,523
I know, I know, I know.

229
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:39,798
What could I do? There are such
liars in the world, such cheats!

230
00:16:39,967 --> 00:16:42,925
And nowhere more, it seems,
than among my own.

231
00:16:43,087 --> 00:16:45,601
I've had to live this long
to find that out.

232
00:16:45,767 --> 00:16:47,837
They’ve made a fool of you.

233
00:16:50,567 --> 00:16:53,559
There are places
where they’ve made a god out of me,

234
00:16:53,727 --> 00:16:56,719
but my own family
have made me a fool

235
00:16:57,487 --> 00:17:00,797
And Livia, it seems,
more than anyone.

236
00:17:04,847 --> 00:17:07,281
- She lied to you.
- Why?.

237
00:17:09,007 --> 00:17:10,998
How did you find out?.

238
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:14,000
- Germanicus told me.
- He wasn't there.

239
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:16,203
Claudius told him, apparently.

240
00:17:16,367 --> 00:17:18,278
What do you make of him, eh?

241
00:17:18,447 --> 00:17:21,359
He's a curious chap.
He's a bit of a fool

242
00:17:21,527 --> 00:17:23,518
Aren't we all?.

243
00:17:26,687 --> 00:17:28,996
I've been wrong
about a lot of things.

244
00:17:31,527 --> 00:17:33,916
Well. I'm here to make amends.

245
00:17:34,087 --> 00:17:36,317
It won't be long
before you're in Rome.

246
00:17:36,487 --> 00:17:40,765
- Can't I return with you now?.
- No. Your banishment is permanent.

247
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:44,886
I must get that decree reversed.
That will take a bit of time.

248
00:17:45,047 --> 00:17:49,279
The moment I set that in motion,
it'll cause a few hearts to flutter

249
00:17:49,447 --> 00:17:51,438
and a few minds to get busy.

250
00:17:51,607 --> 00:17:55,282
I want to wait until Tiberius
is out of Rome.

251
00:17:56,047 --> 00:17:58,515
I'd worry more about Livia
if I were you.

252
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:05,677
When you've lived so long
with a woman...

253
00:18:06,607 --> 00:18:09,440
when she's been more
than a wife to you.

254
00:18:09,607 --> 00:18:12,724
It's been like having
another right arm.

255
00:18:13,087 --> 00:18:15,123
It's hard to believe such things.

256
00:18:16,087 --> 00:18:18,078
Believe them, Father.

257
00:18:19,047 --> 00:18:21,515
I do. I do.

258
00:18:24,167 --> 00:18:25,680
(KNOCKING)

259
00:18:25,847 --> 00:18:27,439
Come in.

260
00:18:28,767 --> 00:18:31,679
Lady, the chief Vestal.
Camilla Pulchra.

261
00:18:37,967 --> 00:18:42,438
You look well. Lady, which is
a blessing for Rome and for all of us.

262
00:18:42,607 --> 00:18:46,202
And you, my dear, are as beautiful
and serene as ever.

263
00:18:49,127 --> 00:18:51,118
Come, let's sit down.

264
00:18:57,247 --> 00:19:00,159
I envy you your serenity.

265
00:19:00,327 --> 00:19:02,602
I envy all the Vestals.

266
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:05,600
I often wish I could have become
one of them.

267
00:19:05,767 --> 00:19:08,235
Rome would have been the loser then.

268
00:19:11,447 --> 00:19:14,325
And you retire next year?.

269
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:17,126
Yes. It's 30 years
since I took my vows.

270
00:19:17,287 --> 00:19:19,642
I must say,
I find it hard to believe.

271
00:19:21,207 --> 00:19:26,600
You came to me some time ago to ask
me to use my influence with Augustus

272
00:19:26,767 --> 00:19:30,316
to persuade the Senate
to rebuild the House of the Vestals.

273
00:19:30,487 --> 00:19:35,402
- That was a long time ago.
- My dear, I never forget anything.

274
00:19:35,567 --> 00:19:40,197
My dream is to leave the House
more beautiful than when I entered it.

275
00:19:40,367 --> 00:19:44,360
The Senate has promised to find
the money, but they never have.

276
00:19:44,527 --> 00:19:49,362
Well. I think
it's time we did something.

277
00:19:49,527 --> 00:19:52,564
- Have you spoken to your husband?
- Many times.

278
00:19:52,727 --> 00:19:55,560
It's been my dream too
to rebuild that house.

279
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:59,720
But, like all men, he makes promises
and noises and does very little.

280
00:19:59,887 --> 00:20:05,405
- But he also likes to surprise me.
- And has he?

281
00:20:05,567 --> 00:20:10,322
Well. I think he has,
but I'm not sure.

282
00:20:10,487 --> 00:20:12,842
That's why I asked you here.

283
00:20:13,567 --> 00:20:17,116
I have a feeling he's set aside
a sum for it in his will

284
00:20:17,287 --> 00:20:20,836
Oh, that would be wonderful!
Do you think he has?

285
00:20:21,007 --> 00:20:23,885
I asked him about it
when he returned from Corsica.

286
00:20:24,047 --> 00:20:26,959
"Wait and see," he said
with such a twinkle in his aye

287
00:20:27,127 --> 00:20:30,642
that it made me wonder
if he'd come to you recently

288
00:20:30,807 --> 00:20:33,162
to make an alteration in his will

289
00:20:33,327 --> 00:20:38,196
But he did! He spent a whole morning
locked in a room with it.

290
00:20:38,367 --> 00:20:41,564
When he came out, he handed me
two documents instead of one.

291
00:20:41,727 --> 00:20:45,515
You see, I was right.
Oh, this intuition of mine.

292
00:20:46,327 --> 00:20:49,603
- Did he bring a witness?
- Yes. Fabius Maximus.

293
00:20:49,767 --> 00:20:51,678
Oh, the artful one!

294
00:20:51,847 --> 00:20:55,999
He's just like a little boy. He has
to be so mysterious about it all

295
00:20:56,167 --> 00:20:58,283
He couldn't come out and say,

296
00:20:58,447 --> 00:21:02,599
"Livia, you shall have your house
for the Vestals when I die."

297
00:21:02,767 --> 00:21:05,440
No. He must tease me.
He must surprise me.

298
00:21:05,607 --> 00:21:07,916
What a dear man he is.

299
00:21:08,087 --> 00:21:11,602
You think then that the alteration
is in respect of that?.

300
00:21:12,687 --> 00:21:15,042
Well. it seems likely.

301
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:20,958
Oh, what a pity we couldn't
take it out and have a look at it.

302
00:21:22,287 --> 00:21:26,678
Just you and me - two women together -
in a tiny little conspiracy.

303
00:21:26,847 --> 00:21:29,998
Yes, that would certainly
set our minds at rest.

304
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,198
But it has his seal on.

305
00:21:35,887 --> 00:21:38,560
Oh, but that's nothing.

306
00:21:39,607 --> 00:21:43,680
I have the use of his seal
I've had it for years.

307
00:21:44,447 --> 00:21:48,440
How else do you think official documents
get signed when he's away?.

308
00:21:49,807 --> 00:21:51,126
Mmm?

309
00:21:53,167 --> 00:21:55,158
I hadn't thought of that.

310
00:21:57,527 --> 00:22:02,476
But then, of course,
that would be breaking my vows.

311
00:22:02,647 --> 00:22:04,638
But in such a good cause.

312
00:22:06,527 --> 00:22:12,636
And if we found the alteration were
in respect of something else,

313
00:22:12,807 --> 00:22:17,676
why, I would feel bound
to find that money myself.

314
00:22:18,447 --> 00:22:22,759
Rome owes so much
to the sanctity of the Vestals.

315
00:22:24,287 --> 00:22:26,596
What do you think, my dear?.

316
00:22:29,487 --> 00:22:33,844
Aaah! Oh, Montanus.
Oh, help me, Montanus.

317
00:22:34,007 --> 00:22:38,125
If you'd lie still
and let the cold compresses work.

318
00:22:40,407 --> 00:22:44,366
Oh, the pain's in my belly,
you fool! Not in my head.

319
00:22:48,607 --> 00:22:50,723
Here, drink this.

320
00:22:51,727 --> 00:22:53,638
It will ease the pain.

321
00:23:04,327 --> 00:23:06,363
It's like a fire in there.

322
00:23:06,527 --> 00:23:10,805
It's the ulcer again. I warned you.
Too much work and too much worry.

323
00:23:10,967 --> 00:23:13,925
- Will you follow an idiot?.
- Yes.

324
00:23:16,047 --> 00:23:19,005
Eat only milk products and eggs.

325
00:23:19,167 --> 00:23:22,443
And give up work for a while
or I won't be responsible.

326
00:23:23,127 --> 00:23:27,359
When you feel a little better, take
a holiday. Go to Capri or somewhere.

327
00:23:27,527 --> 00:23:32,203
Paddle in the sea, get some fresh air.
I'll talk to the Lady Livia.

328
00:23:33,447 --> 00:23:37,326
(SOUND OF AUGUSTUS MOANING)

329
00:24:01,287 --> 00:24:04,324
I've had premonitions.
Premonitions of death.

330
00:24:04,487 --> 00:24:07,957
- We all have them.
- No, no, no. This is serious.

331
00:24:08,127 --> 00:24:11,278
Listen, old friend, let me tell you.

332
00:24:11,447 --> 00:24:14,917
Two weeks after we came back
from you know where,

333
00:24:15,087 --> 00:24:18,636
I was in Mars Field
giving a libation.

334
00:24:18,807 --> 00:24:21,002
A little ceremony. You remember?.

335
00:24:21,167 --> 00:24:23,442
I remember, but I wasn't there.

336
00:24:23,607 --> 00:24:27,805
No? Well. nearby, there's a temple
built in memory of Marcus Agrippa.

337
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:32,438
- Yes, I know it.
- An eagle circled me five times,

338
00:24:32,607 --> 00:24:36,361
then flew off and settled
on the "A" of Agrippa's name.

339
00:24:36,527 --> 00:24:39,325
- Well. Caesar...
- No, don't lie to me.

340
00:24:39,487 --> 00:24:41,478
It's clear what it means.

341
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:44,081
It was telling me
that my time had come

342
00:24:44,247 --> 00:24:47,876
and that I must give way
to someone by the name of Agrippa.

343
00:24:48,047 --> 00:24:50,277
- Postumus?
- Who else?

344
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:55,157
- Did you consult an augur?.
- No. I don't need an augur.

345
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:58,956
Well. you're not an expert
on the interpretation of signs.

346
00:24:59,127 --> 00:25:01,004
Then listen to this.

347
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:06,958
The following day, lightning melted
the "C" on my name on a statue nearby.

348
00:25:07,127 --> 00:25:12,440
It struck the "C" off "Caesar".
Do you follow?. What does "C" mean?

349
00:25:12,607 --> 00:25:15,121
- A hundred.
- A hundred. Exactly!

350
00:25:16,167 --> 00:25:20,126
Livia saw it. She went to an augur
to find out what it meant.

351
00:25:20,287 --> 00:25:23,563
She wouldn't tell me,
but I forced it out of her.

352
00:25:24,047 --> 00:25:28,484
It means that I have only
a hundred days to live.

353
00:25:28,647 --> 00:25:31,480
I shall die in a hundred days.

354
00:25:36,047 --> 00:25:38,083
Or weeks.

355
00:25:41,287 --> 00:25:42,606
Eh?

356
00:25:42,767 --> 00:25:44,837
Why shouldn't it be weeks?

357
00:25:45,887 --> 00:25:47,957
Or months?

358
00:25:48,127 --> 00:25:51,597
Why shouldn't it mean
that you'll live to be a hundred?

359
00:25:54,287 --> 00:25:56,721
- Do you think so?
- Why not?.

360
00:25:58,047 --> 00:26:00,436
Perhaps she went to the wrong augur.

361
00:26:01,607 --> 00:26:04,075
Perhaps he looked at the wrong book.

362
00:26:15,287 --> 00:26:17,801
G-G-Good morning, Grandmother.

363
00:26:19,207 --> 00:26:22,324
Mother and I would like to know

364
00:26:22,487 --> 00:26:25,479
if there's any ch-change
in Augustus' health.

365
00:26:26,327 --> 00:26:29,842
He's improving, which is more
than I can say for you.

366
00:26:30,007 --> 00:26:34,159
Tha-thank you, Grandmother.
It's a gr-great relief.

367
00:26:34,687 --> 00:26:36,245
Yes.

368
00:26:40,007 --> 00:26:41,918
Well. thank you.

369
00:26:42,287 --> 00:26:44,403
Is it true...?

370
00:26:50,287 --> 00:26:52,960
Is it true
that you've written a book

371
00:26:53,127 --> 00:26:56,164
about religious changes
during the reign of Augustus?

372
00:26:56,327 --> 00:26:57,965
Y-y-yes, Grandmother.

373
00:26:58,127 --> 00:27:00,402
You intend to give
a public reading of it?.

374
00:27:00,567 --> 00:27:03,206
- Yes, Grandmother.
- You'll do no such thing.

375
00:27:03,367 --> 00:27:05,358
N-no, Grandmother.

376
00:27:05,527 --> 00:27:11,636
It wasn't my idea. Germanicus
suggested it before he left.

377
00:27:11,807 --> 00:27:14,321
You won't make
a laughing stock of my family.

378
00:27:14,487 --> 00:27:19,607
I'm b-b-better when I'm rehearsed.

379
00:27:19,767 --> 00:27:23,840
So is a trained monkey, but he still
looks and sounds like a monkey.

380
00:27:24,007 --> 00:27:25,759
Yes, Grandmother.

381
00:27:26,727 --> 00:27:29,161
If your head doesn't stop twitching,

382
00:27:29,327 --> 00:27:32,876
I'll have it off and stuck
on a pole. That'll fix it.

383
00:27:33,047 --> 00:27:35,845
Th-th-thank you, Grandmother.

384
00:27:39,807 --> 00:27:43,163
Oh, I beg your... Oh. I'm...
I beg your pardon.

385
00:27:47,007 --> 00:27:49,077
Leave it alone!

386
00:27:56,367 --> 00:27:59,484
That grandson of yours
could wreck the empire...

387
00:28:01,007 --> 00:28:03,123
just by strolling through it.

388
00:28:05,007 --> 00:28:06,998
Augustus is improving.

389
00:28:09,847 --> 00:28:13,317
Are you drinking because
he nearly died or because he didn't?.

390
00:28:13,487 --> 00:28:16,638
- Sarcastic, aren't we?
- I was just wondering.

391
00:28:16,807 --> 00:28:20,880
I never know whether I read you right.
Is something wrong?

392
00:28:22,247 --> 00:28:24,636
He's altered his will

393
00:28:26,167 --> 00:28:28,965
What's the matter -
cat got your tongue?

394
00:28:29,127 --> 00:28:31,516
That took your breath away,
didn't it?.

395
00:28:32,647 --> 00:28:37,596
- How do you know?.
- I make it my business to know.

396
00:28:38,727 --> 00:28:41,799
- In whose favour?.
- Whose do you think?

397
00:28:43,527 --> 00:28:45,757
- Germanicus?
- Ha!

398
00:28:46,687 --> 00:28:49,155
Trust you to get it wrong.

399
00:28:50,207 --> 00:28:53,722
I must have been nodding
when I gave birth to you.

400
00:28:53,887 --> 00:28:57,926
I sometimes wonder that you ever did
anything so natural as giving birth.

401
00:28:58,087 --> 00:29:00,806
In whose favour
has he altered his will?.

402
00:29:00,967 --> 00:29:05,483
Postumus. Whose do you think?
He took a trip to Corsica.

403
00:29:05,647 --> 00:29:08,923
Didn't it occur to you
he may visit your stepson?

404
00:29:09,087 --> 00:29:13,205
- Why should he?
- He's changed his mind about him.

405
00:29:13,367 --> 00:29:15,961
What could have caused him
to change it?.

406
00:29:16,127 --> 00:29:20,120
What does he know now that he didn't
know then? What could he know?.

407
00:29:20,927 --> 00:29:22,724
What is there to know?.

408
00:29:22,887 --> 00:29:26,675
He's a senile old man. How
do I know why he changed his mind?

409
00:29:26,847 --> 00:29:30,840
But he has, and so much
the worse for you, my baby,

410
00:29:31,007 --> 00:29:32,838
if I can't change it back again.

411
00:29:33,007 --> 00:29:36,682
Well. don't bother on my account!
I'm sick of it!

412
00:29:36,847 --> 00:29:39,122
The gods know I've done my best!

413
00:29:39,287 --> 00:29:41,676
He never liked me. Never!

414
00:29:42,487 --> 00:29:45,559
Thirty years I've run his errands
for him!

415
00:29:45,727 --> 00:29:49,436
I've fought on his bloody frontiers,
collected his taxes!

416
00:29:49,607 --> 00:29:52,838
He's never once put his hand on mine
and said, "Thank you.

417
00:29:53,007 --> 00:29:55,316
"What would I have done
without you?"

418
00:29:55,487 --> 00:29:59,321
Now he sends me off to Illyricum
without a farewell dinner.

419
00:29:59,487 --> 00:30:04,356
Not even a goodbye.
Just get on your horse and ride!

420
00:30:06,207 --> 00:30:08,323
Well. damn him!

421
00:30:09,087 --> 00:30:12,159
I retired before
and I can retire again!

422
00:30:12,327 --> 00:30:15,763
Let his precious grandson
run his empire for him.

423
00:30:15,927 --> 00:30:18,964
I'm sick to death of it!

424
00:30:27,447 --> 00:30:30,405
- When do you leave?
- Very soon.

425
00:30:31,367 --> 00:30:34,359
I wouldn't travel too fast,
if I were you.

426
00:30:34,527 --> 00:30:36,040
Why not?.

427
00:30:36,207 --> 00:30:42,840
Well. you won't have so far to come
back if anything happens to him.

428
00:30:45,567 --> 00:30:50,197
I was just going to see your mother.
I've heard she's not very well

429
00:30:50,367 --> 00:30:53,677
I wanted a word, but I'm dragging you
away from your work.

430
00:30:53,847 --> 00:30:57,157
- N-no, really.
- I'll only stay a minute.

431
00:30:58,247 --> 00:31:00,442
Are you b-better now?.

432
00:31:01,047 --> 00:31:03,561
Well. you know, I think so.

433
00:31:04,167 --> 00:31:07,284
Well. shall we sit down
for a moment?.

434
00:31:07,447 --> 00:31:08,800
P-please.

435
00:31:13,167 --> 00:31:17,046
They put me on this diet, you know,
but I cured myself.

436
00:31:17,207 --> 00:31:20,961
You know how?. I refused to eat.
Oh, a little milk and fruit.

437
00:31:21,127 --> 00:31:24,199
I got myself this cow
and I milked it myself.

438
00:31:24,367 --> 00:31:28,758
The fruit I picked from the garden,
so it was untouched by human hand,

439
00:31:28,927 --> 00:31:30,360
except my own.

440
00:31:30,527 --> 00:31:35,840
You never know what gets into food.
The slaves are so careless.

441
00:31:36,007 --> 00:31:38,441
Anyway, I'm still here.

442
00:31:38,607 --> 00:31:42,919
Yes. I'm going away
for a little holiday.

443
00:31:43,087 --> 00:31:46,045
First to Capri and then to Nola.
I'm a bit tired.

444
00:31:49,087 --> 00:31:53,126
What a pleasant garden this is.
I've never been here before.

445
00:32:01,247 --> 00:32:04,319
Claudius, do you bear me
any ill will?.

446
00:32:04,487 --> 00:32:07,001
Ill will?. Why should I?

447
00:32:08,807 --> 00:32:12,766
Oh, we can be so wrong about people.
I was wrong about you.

448
00:32:12,927 --> 00:32:15,361
We judge too much on appearances.

449
00:32:15,527 --> 00:32:19,281
I mean, your appearance is against you.
You know that, don't you?

450
00:32:19,447 --> 00:32:23,520
You give everybody the impression
you're a bit of a fool

451
00:32:24,407 --> 00:32:26,841
But you're not such a fool. are you?

452
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:29,523
I hope n-not.

453
00:32:30,447 --> 00:32:32,597
Germanicus told me all about you.

454
00:32:34,447 --> 00:32:38,076
He said that you were loyal
to three things -

455
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:41,842
to your friends, to Rome
and to the truth.

456
00:32:42,007 --> 00:32:44,805
That's a wonderful thing
to say of a person.

457
00:32:44,967 --> 00:32:47,083
I'd be proud if he said that of me.

458
00:32:47,247 --> 00:32:49,556
My brother worships you.

459
00:32:49,727 --> 00:32:52,878
- No? Do you think so?
- Yes. He's often told me.

460
00:32:53,047 --> 00:32:54,799
Well. well

461
00:32:54,967 --> 00:32:59,006
He's a great man, you know.
A fine Roman in the best tradition -

462
00:32:59,167 --> 00:33:01,681
even though he is
a bit of a republican.

463
00:33:03,047 --> 00:33:05,481
What did you think? I didn't know?.

464
00:33:06,687 --> 00:33:10,362
I'm a republican myself at heart.
You know that, don't you?

465
00:33:10,527 --> 00:33:13,087
It was never my intention
to rule for so long,

466
00:33:13,247 --> 00:33:16,444
but...I don't know,
things just didn't work out.

467
00:33:16,607 --> 00:33:20,316
I kept wanting to retire.
Your father wanted me to retire.

468
00:33:20,487 --> 00:33:23,604
I don't know.
It just never happened.

469
00:33:23,767 --> 00:33:28,636
So many things turn out different
from the way you hoped.

470
00:33:31,327 --> 00:33:35,559
I went to Corsica, you know,
and I paid a visit to a certain island

471
00:33:35,727 --> 00:33:37,957
and I saw a certain person.

472
00:33:38,127 --> 00:33:42,120
None of that would have happened
but for you. Germanicus told me.

473
00:33:42,287 --> 00:33:46,246
Anyway, when I got back,
I paid a visit to the Vestal Virgins

474
00:33:46,407 --> 00:33:50,844
and I made some alterations
to a certain document there.

475
00:33:51,007 --> 00:33:56,240
No one knows about that - not even
your grandmother - so not a word.

476
00:33:56,407 --> 00:33:58,443
Oh, you can tr-trust me.

477
00:33:59,407 --> 00:34:02,717
Yes. I see now that I can.

478
00:34:04,007 --> 00:34:08,444
When I get back, we'll talk again.
We'll talk many times, eh?

479
00:34:10,047 --> 00:34:12,197
I've found another friend.

480
00:34:12,367 --> 00:34:17,646
Even at my age, a man finds he has
friends he never even dreamed of.

481
00:34:24,847 --> 00:34:26,917
(HAPPY SHOUTING)

482
00:34:28,127 --> 00:34:32,166
What luck, Livia! I've thrown Venus
three times in a row!

483
00:34:32,327 --> 00:34:34,397
Come on, pay up, all of you!

484
00:34:35,367 --> 00:34:38,598
Oh, what luck, Livia!
You never saw such a...

485
00:34:38,767 --> 00:34:40,997
Come and play.
I'm winning a fortune.

486
00:34:41,167 --> 00:34:44,603
- Don't you think it's time for bed?
- Certainly not.

487
00:34:44,767 --> 00:34:47,361
We'll start again. Odds or evens?

488
00:34:47,527 --> 00:34:50,041
- Odds! Odds!
- Evens!

489
00:34:51,767 --> 00:34:53,997
Junius, you're not batting.

490
00:34:54,167 --> 00:34:56,522
Caesar, I have no money. It's gone.

491
00:34:56,687 --> 00:34:58,962
Really?. Come on, have some of mine.

492
00:34:59,127 --> 00:35:03,678
- But you gave us all the money.
- It's only a game.

493
00:35:03,847 --> 00:35:07,317
But if we win, we keep it
and if we lose, you give it back.

494
00:35:07,487 --> 00:35:10,160
Who's complaining?
Come on, make your boot.

495
00:35:10,327 --> 00:35:12,841
- Montanus, have you .
- Odds, Caesar.

496
00:35:13,007 --> 00:35:16,124
You'll be sorry.
I've been throwing evens all night.

497
00:35:16,967 --> 00:35:19,959
- Evens!
- Odds! Odds!

498
00:35:22,647 --> 00:35:24,365
Ha! Ha!

499
00:35:25,247 --> 00:35:27,681
What did I tell you?
Come on, pay up.

500
00:35:27,847 --> 00:35:31,999
Who boot odds? Come on,
don't slink away. I saw you!

501
00:35:32,167 --> 00:35:34,044
Oh, what an evening.

502
00:35:35,647 --> 00:35:39,276
Evens, collect your winnings.
Odds, pay up.

503
00:35:57,567 --> 00:36:01,719
- What's the matter?.
- I feel sick.

504
00:36:19,487 --> 00:36:21,921
(HE RETCHES)

505
00:36:34,727 --> 00:36:36,718
Take me to my room.

506
00:36:59,687 --> 00:37:02,804
No food! Do you hear?.

507
00:37:04,167 --> 00:37:08,001
I'll eat figs from the garden,
nothing else.

508
00:37:08,167 --> 00:37:09,566
Nothing!

509
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:12,844
And I'll pick them myself.

510
00:37:13,007 --> 00:37:15,282
Are you mad? Figs from the garden?

511
00:37:15,447 --> 00:37:18,439
Aren't your bowels loose enough?
I must give you medicine.

512
00:37:18,607 --> 00:37:23,158
No! Curse it! Nothing that's been
touched by human hand, do you hear?.

513
00:37:23,327 --> 00:37:27,115
Not even Livia's. Nothing.

514
00:37:27,847 --> 00:37:29,166
Nothing.

515
00:37:29,327 --> 00:37:31,602
It's a very bad attack.

516
00:37:33,687 --> 00:37:37,566
He'll eat no prepared food, none.
Those are his instructions.

517
00:37:37,727 --> 00:37:41,481
Only figs from the tree.
Perhaps he's right, I don't know.

518
00:37:41,647 --> 00:37:46,038
- He cured himself before.
- Did he give any reason?

519
00:37:46,207 --> 00:37:47,606
None.

520
00:37:47,767 --> 00:37:52,318
It mustn't be touched by human hand,
not even by yours.

521
00:37:52,487 --> 00:37:54,557
Perhaps he's right after all

522
00:37:54,727 --> 00:37:56,763
No matter how many times
one tells them,

523
00:37:56,927 --> 00:38:00,806
the kitchen staff never wash
their hands after using the lavatory.

524
00:38:00,967 --> 00:38:06,087
He's too ill to go to Rome. He'll have
to stay here in Nola for a few days.

525
00:38:46,847 --> 00:38:48,883
Are you feeling better?.

526
00:38:52,207 --> 00:38:55,085
There's a delegation here from Rome.

527
00:38:55,247 --> 00:38:57,636
They’re waiting to see you.

528
00:39:01,767 --> 00:39:05,362
Well. you're a fine one.

529
00:39:06,327 --> 00:39:09,319
You made yourself worse
with all those figs.

530
00:39:09,487 --> 00:39:12,285
I never heard anything
so ridiculous.

531
00:39:13,167 --> 00:39:16,159
I only came on this journey
to look after you,

532
00:39:16,327 --> 00:39:19,478
and you won't let me
or anyone else cook for you.

533
00:39:21,007 --> 00:39:23,567
It's very embarrassing, you know.

534
00:39:23,727 --> 00:39:26,799
People might think
we were trying to poison you.

535
00:39:34,007 --> 00:39:35,998
I sent for Tiberius.

536
00:39:37,087 --> 00:39:41,160
Fortunately, he wasn't too far away.
He'll be here soon.

537
00:39:44,087 --> 00:39:48,956
Well. I thought
you might want to see him.

538
00:39:51,607 --> 00:39:55,282
And he'll do everything
that has to be done.

539
00:39:57,447 --> 00:39:59,358
Hasn't he always?

540
00:40:02,447 --> 00:40:09,205
Of course...you two haven't
always seen aye to aye.

541
00:40:11,767 --> 00:40:15,999
But that hasn't been entirely
his fault, you know that, don't you?

542
00:40:17,567 --> 00:40:21,321
You were always inclined
to favour one over the other.

543
00:40:22,687 --> 00:40:24,917
I've often spoken to you about it.

544
00:40:26,727 --> 00:40:30,481
You made fish of one
and foul of the other so often

545
00:40:30,647 --> 00:40:33,684
that no one knew where he was
or what he was.

546
00:40:38,647 --> 00:40:41,286
You should have listened to me more.

547
00:40:42,527 --> 00:40:44,324
You should have.

548
00:40:46,247 --> 00:40:48,477
You know that, don't you?

549
00:40:50,207 --> 00:40:54,485
I've been right more often
than you have, you know.

550
00:40:56,687 --> 00:41:00,999
But because I was a woman,
you pushed me into the background.

551
00:41:02,487 --> 00:41:06,036
Oh, yes...yes, you did.

552
00:41:08,607 --> 00:41:15,319
And all I ever wanted was for you
and for Rome.

553
00:41:18,367 --> 00:41:21,996
Nothing I ever did was for myself.

554
00:41:22,967 --> 00:41:24,400
Nothing.

555
00:41:25,727 --> 00:41:29,800
Only for you...and for Rome.

556
00:41:32,127 --> 00:41:34,687
As a Claudian should.

557
00:41:37,447 --> 00:41:41,520
Oh, yes, my dear. I'm a Claudian.

558
00:41:44,607 --> 00:41:47,883
I think you are apt
to forget that at times.

559
00:41:50,047 --> 00:41:52,038
But I never did.

560
00:41:52,607 --> 00:41:53,926
No.

561
00:41:55,087 --> 00:41:56,486
Never.

562
00:41:59,047 --> 00:42:00,400
No.

563
00:42:22,407 --> 00:42:24,523
(KNOCKING, DOOR OPENS)

564
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:29,798
How is he?

565
00:42:34,407 --> 00:42:36,159
He's dead.

566
00:42:41,647 --> 00:42:43,842
Augustus is dead.

567
00:42:45,967 --> 00:42:48,037
The earth will shake.

568
00:42:58,567 --> 00:43:02,355
I must go and see the senators
and the consuls from Rome.

569
00:43:04,607 --> 00:43:07,246
Stay with him till I return.

570
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:14,003
By the way...

571
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:17,716
don't touch the figs.

572
00:43:26,087 --> 00:43:29,557
Augustus has fallen
into a deep sleep.

573
00:43:31,767 --> 00:43:35,555
He willed himself to stay awake
until my son arrived

574
00:43:35,727 --> 00:43:40,755
and then, comforted by his return,
he dozed off.

575
00:43:43,207 --> 00:43:45,767
There's no point
in your waiting here.

576
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:49,323
Come back again tomorrow.

577
00:43:50,167 --> 00:43:53,842
Between now and then,
I will post bulletins on the door.

578
00:44:14,487 --> 00:44:17,126
- You are Colonel Sejanus?
- Yes, Lady.

579
00:44:17,447 --> 00:44:19,677
The son of the Commander
of the Guard?

580
00:44:19,847 --> 00:44:21,405
Yes, Lady.

581
00:44:21,567 --> 00:44:25,276
Your father has high regard for you.

582
00:44:25,447 --> 00:44:27,802
I hope you won't find it misplaced.

583
00:44:29,047 --> 00:44:32,357
- You know why you're here?
- Yes. I'll leave at once.

584
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:35,284
- Good.
- Lady.

585
00:45:07,567 --> 00:45:10,877
Weight it with stones.
We'll bury it at sea.

586
00:45:11,247 --> 00:45:13,920
- Are you Fabius Maximus?
- Yes. What's the message?

587
00:45:14,087 --> 00:45:15,486
It's here.

588
00:45:20,527 --> 00:45:22,563
Let the will be read.

589
00:45:36,287 --> 00:45:40,121
"This is the last will and testament

Condolences?

606
00:46:35,047 --> 00:46:37,607
Condolences. Yes, Grandmother.

607
00:46:37,767 --> 00:46:40,235
It's a t-terrible tragedy.

608
00:46:40,807 --> 00:46:43,162
Have you been in the Senate?

609
00:46:44,127 --> 00:46:47,278
On the steps.
I'm not allowed in the Senate.

610
00:46:47,447 --> 00:46:51,963
No, neither am I. They won't allow
me in because I'm a woman

611
00:46:52,127 --> 00:46:56,120
and you because you're a fool
It's strange when you think of it.

612
00:46:56,287 --> 00:46:59,438
It's full of nothing
but old women and fools!

613
00:47:03,127 --> 00:47:05,038
They’ve read the will

614
00:47:06,007 --> 00:47:08,237
That's what they think.

615
00:47:09,207 --> 00:47:10,606
Pardon?

616
00:47:11,167 --> 00:47:13,123
Where have they got to?

617
00:47:13,287 --> 00:47:19,237
They asked Uncle T-Tiberius to take
Augustus' place, but he refused.

618
00:47:19,407 --> 00:47:24,322
And I'll boot they asked him again,
and I'll boot that he said yes.

619
00:47:24,487 --> 00:47:28,196
- Yes, he did.
- Well. what are they doing now?.

620
00:47:28,367 --> 00:47:31,723
Debating whether
to make Augustus a god.

621
00:47:31,887 --> 00:47:36,039
Debating, are they?.
What do you think?

622
00:47:37,327 --> 00:47:42,447
I think they should.
I think it was f-f-foretold.

623
00:47:42,607 --> 00:47:46,520
Really, now?. And who foretold it?.

624
00:47:48,967 --> 00:47:52,926
J-J-J-Jove.

625
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:55,078
Jove, eh?

626
00:47:55,247 --> 00:48:00,879
A hundred days ago, he melted
the "C" on one of Augustus' statues.

627
00:48:01,047 --> 00:48:03,242
And what does that mean, idiot head?

628
00:48:03,407 --> 00:48:07,082
If you strike out the letter "C"
from "Caesar",

629
00:48:07,247 --> 00:48:13,846
the word "Aesar" is left,
and in Etruscan, Aesar means "god".

630
00:48:14,007 --> 00:48:17,079
Deciphered some Etruscan now,
have we?

631
00:48:17,247 --> 00:48:21,160
Yes, Grandmother.
I've been studying it.

632
00:48:21,327 --> 00:48:23,283
Oh, you fool

633
00:48:24,367 --> 00:48:27,916
If Jove wanted to talk to us,

634
00:48:28,087 --> 00:48:31,716
don't you think he'd talk to us
in Latin, not in Etruscan?

635
00:48:31,887 --> 00:48:36,085
What'd be the point of that?.
Hadn't thought of that, had you?

636
00:48:36,967 --> 00:48:41,916
All the same, I'd drop a note
to Tiberius, if I were you.

637
00:48:42,087 --> 00:48:45,397
He could use all the arguments
he could get.

638
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:48,957
Will they make Augustus a g-g-god?

639
00:48:49,127 --> 00:48:52,483
Oh, yes. He is a god.

640
00:48:53,927 --> 00:48:58,682
And so shall I be one day,
I prophesy.

641
00:49:00,247 --> 00:49:02,397
And here's another prophecy.

642
00:49:02,887 --> 00:49:06,960
If Jove ever melts the "C"
off your name,

643
00:49:07,127 --> 00:49:10,802
what's left will turn out
to mean "jackass".

644
00:49:13,887 --> 00:49:16,355
Bye-bye, Clau-Clau.

645
00:49:17,687 --> 00:49:19,837
All right. You can go now.

646
00:49:27,767 --> 00:49:29,883
You wicked woman!

647
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:32,005
Wickedness!

648
00:49:32,167 --> 00:49:35,842
Here, what's this? Eh?
Augustus' will!

649
00:49:36,007 --> 00:49:38,043
You stole it!

650
00:49:38,567 --> 00:49:41,127
His last will!

651
00:49:41,287 --> 00:49:42,845
(HER LAUGHTER ECHOES)

652
00:49:43,007 --> 00:49:45,043
Poison is queen!

653
00:49:46,407 --> 00:49:48,557
Poison is queen!

654
00:49:49,447 --> 00:49:51,836
Stop it! Stop it!

655
00:49:52,767 --> 00:49:54,200
Stop it!

656
00:49:54,367 --> 00:49:57,006
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

657
00:49:57,167 --> 00:49:58,759
(SILENCE)
