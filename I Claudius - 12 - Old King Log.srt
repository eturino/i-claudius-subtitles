1
00:01:00,167 --> 00:01:02,886
- Is he dead?
- Yes.

2
00:01:03,047 --> 00:01:05,561
Yes, he's dead.

3
00:01:05,967 --> 00:01:09,642
Then I am Emperor.

4
00:01:10,407 --> 00:01:12,318
- Yes.
- Whee!

5
00:01:12,487 --> 00:01:13,886
Sh!

6
00:01:16,567 --> 00:01:18,956
You are Emperor.

7
00:01:19,127 --> 00:01:23,006
Everything I ever dreamed of
has come true.

8
00:01:23,687 --> 00:01:25,279
Emperor.

9
00:01:25,447 --> 00:01:28,723
I am Emperor of Rome.

10
00:01:30,127 --> 00:01:31,924
I feel sorry for him, don't you?

11
00:01:32,087 --> 00:01:34,043
- No.
- No? Neither do I.

12
00:01:34,207 --> 00:01:36,675
- Let's announce his death.
- Not yet.

13
00:01:37,607 --> 00:01:41,316
We'll put out a bulletin saying
he's as well as can be expected.

14
00:01:41,487 --> 00:01:44,001
- Considering he's dead!
- Yes.

15
00:01:44,167 --> 00:01:48,683
Then we must find the will
It will be in his study.

16
00:01:51,727 --> 00:01:53,126
Come!

17
00:02:04,047 --> 00:02:06,356
What a mess!

18
00:02:07,407 --> 00:02:10,558
He would never let anyone touch it,
that's why.

19
00:02:11,447 --> 00:02:14,041
It will be here somewhere.

20
00:02:14,207 --> 00:02:16,767
You look over there
and I'll look here.

21
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:59,483
(CLAUDIUS) Write no more,
Claudius Write no more.

22
00:03:02,647 --> 00:03:04,683
Have you found it, Mother?.

23
00:03:04,847 --> 00:03:08,123
- Well. what is it?.
- It looks like a history.

24
00:03:08,287 --> 00:03:11,757
- Of what?.
- Of our family.

25
00:03:12,167 --> 00:03:14,158
Does it mention me?

26
00:03:14,767 --> 00:03:16,758
Where does it begin?

27
00:03:16,927 --> 00:03:20,158
With the death of his last wife,
Messalina.

28
00:03:20,327 --> 00:03:22,238
What does it say about me?

29
00:03:22,407 --> 00:03:25,922
Be quiet! How can I tell
if you keep talking to me?

30
00:03:27,567 --> 00:03:30,240
The frog pool wanted a king.

31
00:03:30,927 --> 00:03:33,839
Jove sent them Old King Log.

32
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:39,641
I have been as deaf and blind
and wooden as a log.

33
00:03:40,447 --> 00:03:44,326
My chief fault?
I have been too benevolent

34
00:03:45,207 --> 00:03:48,165
I repaired the ruin
my predecessors spread.

35
00:03:49,007 --> 00:03:52,636
I reconciled Rome and the world
to monarchy again.

36
00:03:54,287 --> 00:03:57,882
By dulling the blade of tyranny,
I fell into great error.

37
00:03:58,367 --> 00:04:01,677
By sharpening that blade
I might redeem that error.

38
00:04:01,847 --> 00:04:05,965
Violent disorders call
for violent remedies

39
00:04:07,607 --> 00:04:13,284
Yet I am, I must remember,
Old King Log.

40
00:04:14,327 --> 00:04:18,400
I shall float inertly
in the stagnant pool

41
00:04:19,647 --> 00:04:24,357
Let all the poisons
that lurk in the mud hatch out

42
00:04:25,767 --> 00:04:27,359
Yes

43
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:34,806
Let all the poisons
that lurk in the mud hatch out

44
00:04:36,167 --> 00:04:38,522
She did not please you, Caesar?.

45
00:04:39,767 --> 00:04:41,917
No, I can see she did not.

46
00:04:43,087 --> 00:04:45,203
It was a mistake having her here.

47
00:04:46,767 --> 00:04:48,644
A beautiful woman though.

48
00:04:49,927 --> 00:04:54,762
Yes. Beautiful woman. Whoever
marries her will be a fortunate man.

49
00:04:56,167 --> 00:04:59,557
- She's married already.
- Really?.

50
00:04:59,727 --> 00:05:01,957
To the drummer.

51
00:05:03,407 --> 00:05:07,241
- And has three children.
- Oh, I envy him.

52
00:05:08,447 --> 00:05:10,244
He tells me she's a shrew.

53
00:05:11,287 --> 00:05:14,882
Then I envy him his nights,
but not his days.

54
00:05:16,047 --> 00:05:19,437
In marriage, one can't
have one without the other.

55
00:05:22,967 --> 00:05:27,085
You see, Caesar, how even vagabonds
and gypsies like those

56
00:05:27,247 --> 00:05:31,320
recognise the virtues of marriage
and a family...life.

57
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:36,359
Caesar?. Are you well?.

58
00:05:38,327 --> 00:05:40,283
Is something the matter?.

59
00:05:46,287 --> 00:05:53,796
Let all the poisons
that lurk in the mud hatch out

60
00:05:55,207 --> 00:05:57,118
If you will allow us, Caesar,

61
00:05:57,287 --> 00:06:00,597
to raise once again
the subject of your remarrying?

62
00:06:02,127 --> 00:06:04,402
There are so many good reasons
for it.

63
00:06:04,567 --> 00:06:08,003
But, chiefly,
your children need a mother.

64
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:12,240
And Rome needs a mother. It's not
right for an Emperor to be alone.

65
00:06:12,407 --> 00:06:15,843
Your Uncle Tiberius was alone.
It affected his mind.

66
00:06:16,007 --> 00:06:20,364
It doesn't follow that because
your three marriages were a tragedy

67
00:06:20,527 --> 00:06:22,916
your fourth shouldn't be a triumph.

68
00:06:25,767 --> 00:06:28,645
I've given this matter
a great deal of thought,

69
00:06:28,807 --> 00:06:31,241
and there's someone
I'd like to recommend.

70
00:06:31,407 --> 00:06:34,080
- You never mentioned that.
- I thought of it today.

71
00:06:34,247 --> 00:06:38,286
Caesar, the one woman in Rome
who would be a perfect wife

72
00:06:38,447 --> 00:06:40,324
is Lollia Paulina.

73
00:06:40,487 --> 00:06:42,284
Lollia Paulina?

74
00:06:43,767 --> 00:06:45,325
Are you mad?

75
00:06:45,487 --> 00:06:48,524
She's ideal
She's the daughter of an ex-consul

76
00:06:48,687 --> 00:06:52,680
She's lost none of her looks
with age, and she's still childless,

77
00:06:52,847 --> 00:06:57,284
so she'll be good for Britannicus
and Octavia. They need a mother.

78
00:06:57,447 --> 00:06:59,324
That's more important than anything.

79
00:06:59,487 --> 00:07:02,160
But she's the stupidest woman
in Rome.

80
00:07:02,327 --> 00:07:05,842
The Emperor has had clever ones
that have done him little good.

81
00:07:06,007 --> 00:07:10,956
She's an absurd choice.
She thinks of nothing but ornaments.

82
00:07:11,127 --> 00:07:15,484
- The Emperor needs...
- A wife capable of helping him.

83
00:07:16,327 --> 00:07:21,242
Caesar, I have submitted many names
in the past for your consideration.

84
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:24,717
I have been less than enthusiastic
about most of them.

85
00:07:24,887 --> 00:07:27,447
That didn't prevent you
putting them forward.

86
00:07:27,607 --> 00:07:29,962
It was not I who was to marry them.

87
00:07:30,127 --> 00:07:33,881
One can recommend with
less enthusiasm than one marries.

88
00:07:34,047 --> 00:07:37,005
- Caesar...
- As I was about to say, Caesar!

89
00:07:45,287 --> 00:07:51,078
One name comes to me now
with all the force of divine revelation.

90
00:07:52,047 --> 00:07:54,720
The lady has been
in front of us all the time -

91
00:07:54,887 --> 00:07:57,924
so close, in fact
that we've not noticed her.

92
00:07:58,767 --> 00:08:02,077
I refer to the Lady Agrippinilla.

93
00:08:02,247 --> 00:08:06,160
The Lady Agrippinilla?! Are you mad?
She's the Emperor's niece!

94
00:08:06,327 --> 00:08:09,876
The union would be incestuous.
The Senate wouldn't allow it.

95
00:08:10,047 --> 00:08:13,084
A hundred years ago,
first cousins couldn't marry.

96
00:08:13,247 --> 00:08:16,637
Now it's done all the time.
The Senate will agree.

97
00:08:16,807 --> 00:08:20,959
Now, Caesar,
she's in every way suitable.

98
00:08:21,127 --> 00:08:25,359
She's a woman of intelligence,
the daughter of Germanicus,

99
00:08:25,527 --> 00:08:29,156
and she would bring with her
the grandson of Germanicus -

100
00:08:29,327 --> 00:08:33,240
Nero, a boy worthy in every respect
of Imperial fortune.

101
00:08:33,407 --> 00:08:36,797
But the Emperor loathes Nero!
A hideous boy.

102
00:08:36,967 --> 00:08:40,198
You are speaking of the Emperor's
grand-nephew!

103
00:08:40,367 --> 00:08:43,279
I speak the Emperor's own words!
And I'll go further.

104
00:08:43,447 --> 00:08:47,440
His mother is the most corrupt woman
in Rome. Even Caligula said so!

105
00:08:47,607 --> 00:08:49,916
How dare you? How dare you?

106
00:08:51,647 --> 00:08:56,163
Narcissus, you may consider
our friendship at an end.

107
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,636
From this moment, at an end!

108
00:08:58,807 --> 00:09:00,126
Caesar...

109
00:09:00,287 --> 00:09:06,044
Caesar! I cannot support these
monstrous calumnies against her.

110
00:09:06,207 --> 00:09:08,084
- Caesar...
- In my opinion...!

111
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:10,556
you niece is the finest woman
in Rome.

112
00:09:10,727 --> 00:09:14,879
An Emperor should have a wife
who is both good looking,

113
00:09:15,047 --> 00:09:17,800
and of outstanding intelligence.
She has both!

114
00:09:17,967 --> 00:09:20,686
I beg you to consider her.

115
00:09:20,847 --> 00:09:23,486
It would be the Lady Messalina
all over again.

116
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:26,241
Worse! The Lady Messalina
with brains.

117
00:09:26,407 --> 00:09:30,241
That's a combination more deadly
than all the tribes of Germany.

118
00:09:30,407 --> 00:09:35,197
And she'll soon want that son
of hers adopted into the family.

119
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:37,927
Caesar, Caesar, I beg you.

120
00:09:39,607 --> 00:09:42,917
Caesar, an uncle does not marry
his niece.

121
00:09:43,087 --> 00:09:46,443
The union will be incestuous
and the gods abominate incest.

122
00:09:46,607 --> 00:09:49,758
It will bring ruin and destruction
on Rome.

123
00:09:53,047 --> 00:09:58,565
Let all the poisons
that lurk in the mud...

124
00:10:00,087 --> 00:10:01,805
hatch out.

125
00:10:03,807 --> 00:10:05,206
Caesar?.

126
00:10:06,727 --> 00:10:11,960
Let all the p-poisons
that lurk in the mud...

127
00:10:15,447 --> 00:10:17,278
hatch out.

128
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:35,362
I will m-marry my niece.

129
00:10:36,527 --> 00:10:38,563
B-bring her to me.

130
00:10:52,887 --> 00:10:54,718
(KNOCKING)

131
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:56,366
Come in.

132
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,640
Well?.

133
00:11:11,407 --> 00:11:13,204
He's agreed.

134
00:11:14,527 --> 00:11:16,518
He has agreed.

135
00:11:17,687 --> 00:11:19,643
He wants to see you.

136
00:11:20,527 --> 00:11:22,836
- Now?.
- Yes.

137
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:27,205
It was so easy
I could hardly believe it.

138
00:11:29,887 --> 00:11:33,243
He'll marry me?
He said he'd marry me?

139
00:11:33,407 --> 00:11:34,840
Yes.

140
00:11:35,647 --> 00:11:37,524
What did he say?.

141
00:11:38,407 --> 00:11:42,241
"I will marry my niece.
Send her to me."

142
00:11:43,567 --> 00:11:44,966
That's all?.

143
00:11:46,007 --> 00:11:49,363
Nothing else? No arguments?
No opposition?

144
00:11:49,527 --> 00:11:52,405
- Only from Narcissus.
- Ah.

145
00:11:53,927 --> 00:11:56,236
- What did he say?.
- I shan't repeat it.

146
00:11:56,407 --> 00:11:59,717
What does it matter?. He lost.
It was only sour grapes.

147
00:12:00,527 --> 00:12:03,837
I'll sour all his grapes
before I'm done.

148
00:12:06,007 --> 00:12:09,283
And Claudius? He said nothing
about my being his niece?

149
00:12:09,447 --> 00:12:10,766
Nothing.

150
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:15,679
- Nothing about incest?.
- Nothing.

151
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:23,123
Perhaps he fancies the idea.

152
00:12:23,287 --> 00:12:25,198
I wouldn't blame him.

153
00:12:26,527 --> 00:12:29,758
I shan't like it though,
the thought of you in his bed.

154
00:12:30,727 --> 00:12:33,195
I'm beginning to have regrets
already.

155
00:12:34,247 --> 00:12:38,206
I found it hard, when it came to it,
to suggest you.

156
00:12:39,087 --> 00:12:41,157
It didn't stop you though, did it?.

157
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:42,646
No.

158
00:12:43,527 --> 00:12:47,440
Your ambition always burned
more brightly than your passion.

159
00:12:48,487 --> 00:12:51,047
Have you ever found my passion
wanting?

160
00:12:51,207 --> 00:12:52,640
No.

161
00:12:54,047 --> 00:12:58,802
But in my case, passion and ambition
are beautifully combined...

162
00:12:59,727 --> 00:13:01,604
aren't they?.

163
00:13:02,207 --> 00:13:05,119
I'm beginning to have regrets
already.

164
00:13:05,887 --> 00:13:07,923
My regrets are mounting.

165
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:11,921
- I hope when you're married...
- Don't be silly.

166
00:13:14,767 --> 00:13:17,076
Oh, I've hurt you.

167
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,163
And I shouldn't have.

168
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:25,485
Don't worry. I'll make it up to you.

169
00:13:29,607 --> 00:13:32,280
Now. Make it up to me now.

170
00:13:33,807 --> 00:13:36,765
- He's waiting for me.
- It won't take long.

171
00:13:37,247 --> 00:13:42,719
You see, for once, my passion
burns brighter than my ambition.

172
00:13:44,167 --> 00:13:49,764
Hurry, then. I imagine his passion
is burning too...

173
00:13:51,167 --> 00:13:54,682
and at his age,
the flames don't last very long.

174
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:57,358
(KNOCKING)

175
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:05,559
Uncle? Pallas tells me
you wanted to see me.

176
00:14:05,727 --> 00:14:07,046
Yes.

177
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:10,966
He said that you had decided
to marry again.

178
00:14:11,127 --> 00:14:12,446
Yes.

179
00:14:13,367 --> 00:14:15,562
And that you had chosen me?

180
00:14:16,527 --> 00:14:18,677
Would you like to marry me?

181
00:14:19,207 --> 00:14:21,721
Oh, Uncle!

182
00:14:25,647 --> 00:14:29,242
You have made me the happiest woman
in the world.

183
00:14:29,407 --> 00:14:31,682
Yes, I thought I might.

184
00:14:31,847 --> 00:14:33,838
How could you know that?.

185
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:39,806
How could you know that I've loved
and respected you all these years?

186
00:14:39,967 --> 00:14:43,118
I just guessed it, my dear,
just guessed it.

187
00:14:43,767 --> 00:14:46,964
I shall be such a good wife to you,
you'll see.

188
00:14:47,127 --> 00:14:50,324
And I shall be a mother
to Britannicus and Octavia

189
00:14:50,487 --> 00:14:53,479
just as I am to my own dear Nero.

190
00:14:53,647 --> 00:14:57,435
They shall be to me
as if they were my own.

191
00:14:58,407 --> 00:15:01,797
And there'll be more, why not?.

192
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:05,198
I'm still capable
of bearing children.

193
00:15:06,087 --> 00:15:09,682
And you, such a vigorous man.

194
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:14,240
Such firm flesh.
Who would have thought it?.

195
00:15:15,527 --> 00:15:20,043
You shall have more sons,
I promise you.

196
00:15:20,207 --> 00:15:23,324
And more love
than you have ever had.

197
00:15:24,567 --> 00:15:26,080
Yes.

198
00:15:26,247 --> 00:15:31,241
Love, Uncle, such as you
have never known before.

199
00:15:33,087 --> 00:15:37,000
Oh, it makes my head reel
to think of it.

200
00:15:42,127 --> 00:15:46,962
Does it not worry you, my dear,
that you will be committing incest?.

201
00:15:47,687 --> 00:15:51,475
Oh, but you've done that so many
times before, haven't you?

202
00:15:51,647 --> 00:15:54,480
With your brother, Caligula?

203
00:15:55,007 --> 00:15:59,717
We all did things then that
we might not otherwise have done.

204
00:15:59,887 --> 00:16:02,117
That's true. That is true.

205
00:16:02,287 --> 00:16:06,485
Only some of us did them more
willingly than others, didn't we?

206
00:16:06,647 --> 00:16:09,286
I'm not blaming you.
I'm only asking.

207
00:16:10,127 --> 00:16:13,483
Well. since you ask,
the answer is no.

208
00:16:15,047 --> 00:16:20,167
Such incest would be technical only.
But if it disturbs you...

209
00:16:20,327 --> 00:16:23,763
No, I'm teasing.
Please don't be offended.

210
00:16:24,767 --> 00:16:28,885
As a matter of fact the q-question
of incest is somewhat academic.

211
00:16:29,047 --> 00:16:32,357
- What does that mean?
- Beautiful as you are,

212
00:16:32,527 --> 00:16:35,724
your body is of less interest to me
than your mind.

213
00:16:35,887 --> 00:16:39,516
I'm marrying you for your head,
my dear, not your heart,

214
00:16:39,687 --> 00:16:42,360
of which, I suspect,
you have very little.

215
00:16:42,847 --> 00:16:45,122
Well. then, that suits me.

216
00:16:46,247 --> 00:16:49,080
You're not the sort of lover
one dreams of.

217
00:16:49,247 --> 00:16:51,203
Not the sort that you dream of.

218
00:16:51,367 --> 00:16:54,962
Still. I won't discuss your dreams -
not on a full stomach.

219
00:16:55,127 --> 00:16:58,802
I'm marrying you
because I'm tired of ruling alone.

220
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:03,799
There are many things an Emperor's
w=wife can do that others can't.

221
00:17:03,967 --> 00:17:07,562
But I need a woman with a mind.
Does that appeal to you?

222
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:09,160
Admirably.

223
00:17:11,247 --> 00:17:14,319
But I shan't be a cipher,
I can tell you that.

224
00:17:15,927 --> 00:17:19,363
If you give me power,
I shall use it.

225
00:17:20,407 --> 00:17:23,877
Now, why else do you imagine
I'm giving it to you?

226
00:17:27,327 --> 00:17:31,002
- Well?.
- We are to be married.

227
00:17:32,967 --> 00:17:35,561
- But why?.
- Why?.

228
00:17:35,727 --> 00:17:39,402
He doesn't want me to share his bed.
He doesn't even like me.

229
00:17:39,567 --> 00:17:41,922
He says he wants me
to help him rule.

230
00:17:42,087 --> 00:17:46,239
- All the better.
- No, no. There's something odd.

231
00:17:48,247 --> 00:17:51,125
What did he say
when you suggested me?

232
00:17:51,287 --> 00:17:53,118
- I told you.
- Nothing more?

233
00:17:53,287 --> 00:17:55,562
There was something.
It was nonsense.

234
00:17:55,727 --> 00:17:57,604
What?. What did he say?.

235
00:17:57,767 --> 00:18:02,966
Er... "Let all the poisons
that are in the mud hatch out"

236
00:18:03,127 --> 00:18:05,004
or something like that.

237
00:18:09,087 --> 00:18:11,078
Perhaps his mind's going.

238
00:18:13,647 --> 00:18:16,400
Maybe he won't last long
after his marriage.

239
00:18:17,247 --> 00:18:18,680
No.

240
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:23,602
We must keep him alive long enough
for my son to come of age.

241
00:18:30,127 --> 00:18:31,606
Senators.

242
00:18:31,767 --> 00:18:36,841
S-seven years ago, I undertook
the conquest of the island of Britain.

243
00:18:37,007 --> 00:18:40,522
It has taken until now
to complete it.

244
00:18:41,087 --> 00:18:43,885
One man and o-one man alone

245
00:18:44,047 --> 00:18:46,686
has been responsible
for the enormous losses...

246
00:18:46,847 --> 00:18:49,486
The war in Britain
finally came to an end,

247
00:18:49,647 --> 00:18:53,322
and King Caractacus
was brought in chains to Rome.

248
00:18:53,807 --> 00:18:55,763
The Senate called for his death

249
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:59,476
as punishment
for his long resistance to our arms,

250
00:18:59,647 --> 00:19:04,926
but while his family cowered
before us, Caractacus did not.

251
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,884
I'll tell you this.

252
00:19:07,727 --> 00:19:11,879
If the sword is all that you're
prepared to show us Britons,

253
00:19:12,047 --> 00:19:15,835
then be prepared to carry it forever
in your hand...

254
00:19:16,767 --> 00:19:20,726
and sleep with it forever
by your side at night!

255
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:24,639
For you will need it!

256
00:19:26,047 --> 00:19:28,766
(APPLAUSE)

257
00:19:31,847 --> 00:19:35,522
His courage and his dignity
won the hearts of the Senate.

258
00:19:36,687 --> 00:19:40,760
He was granted a pension
and allowed to live in the city.

259
00:19:41,927 --> 00:19:44,122
I'm near the end of my story.

260
00:19:44,287 --> 00:19:48,075
I have been married
to Agrippinilla for five years..

261
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:52,282
and she has turned out
as loathsome as I thought she would.

262
00:19:54,047 --> 00:19:57,119
As has that slimy son of hers.

263
00:19:58,567 --> 00:20:00,876
His mother has plans for him.

264
00:20:01,727 --> 00:20:05,402
She thinks I do not know,
but I do.

265
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:08,995
And I have my own plans

266
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:18,445
- He's very musical
- Yes.

267
00:20:20,807 --> 00:20:23,924
I wonder, Britannicus,
that you don't take lessons.

268
00:20:25,527 --> 00:20:27,438
I'm not interested in music.

269
00:20:28,087 --> 00:20:31,796
Pity. You could play duets together.

270
00:20:33,007 --> 00:20:37,922
That would be very unlikely,
Lucius Domitius being so gifted.

271
00:20:38,087 --> 00:20:41,762
I wish you would stop addressing him
as Lucius Domitius.

272
00:20:41,927 --> 00:20:44,680
He has adopted the name of Nero.

273
00:20:44,847 --> 00:20:46,280
I forgot.

274
00:20:46,447 --> 00:20:51,885
No, you do not forget.
I think you do it deliberately.

275
00:20:52,047 --> 00:20:53,799
I tell you, I forget.

276
00:20:55,527 --> 00:20:57,677
Well. you have been reminded,

277
00:20:57,847 --> 00:21:02,079
which I think calls for a correction
and an apology.

278
00:21:02,247 --> 00:21:05,319
- That isn't necessary, Mother.
- I think it is.

279
00:21:08,047 --> 00:21:09,719
Well?.

280
00:21:11,847 --> 00:21:14,236
I shall not apologise.

281
00:21:15,887 --> 00:21:17,798
I think you will

282
00:21:18,607 --> 00:21:22,236
Claudius, I insist
that you order him to apologise.

283
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:25,205
Apologise to N-Nero, Britannicus.

284
00:21:26,087 --> 00:21:29,284
You've hurt his feelings
and you know how sensitive he is.

285
00:21:31,287 --> 00:21:33,164
You side with them!

286
00:21:33,327 --> 00:21:36,364
You take her side and his against me
all the time.

287
00:21:38,487 --> 00:21:40,876
I shall not apologise!

288
00:21:41,047 --> 00:21:44,119
You'll apologise
or you'll be punished.

289
00:21:45,087 --> 00:21:49,365
What will you do? Have me executed
as you did my mother?.

290
00:21:50,247 --> 00:21:52,442
I detest you all!

291
00:21:53,287 --> 00:21:54,606
All of you!

292
00:21:58,687 --> 00:22:01,360
I'm sorry to have been the cause
of that.

293
00:22:01,527 --> 00:22:04,087
(AGRIPPILLINA) It's not your fault.

294
00:22:04,247 --> 00:22:06,238
Nevertheless, I'll go and see him.

295
00:22:06,407 --> 00:22:11,242
Come, Octavia, let's find your brother.
Perhaps we can pacify him.

296
00:22:11,407 --> 00:22:13,318
I think you're very kind.

297
00:22:13,487 --> 00:22:16,365
There's far too little kindness
in the world.

298
00:22:20,767 --> 00:22:23,520
Have you noticed
how fond they are of each other?.

299
00:22:23,687 --> 00:22:28,841
Everyone's commenting on it.
Nero simply adores her.

300
00:22:34,727 --> 00:22:38,197
There's something I've been wanting
to speak to you about.

301
00:22:38,367 --> 00:22:40,722
- Yes.
- It concerns the matter of...

302
00:22:41,367 --> 00:22:45,758
- Pardon?
- The answer is yes.

303
00:22:45,927 --> 00:22:48,077
You don't know
what I'm going to ask.

304
00:22:48,247 --> 00:22:52,843
Aren't you going to suggest
that I marry Octavia to your son?

305
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:57,244
- Yes.
- The answer is yes.

306
00:22:59,247 --> 00:23:01,078
Don't you wish to discuss it?.

307
00:23:01,247 --> 00:23:04,523
What is there to discuss?
They’ll be well matched.

308
00:23:08,967 --> 00:23:11,356
Nero's very fond you, you know?.

309
00:23:12,407 --> 00:23:14,398
He thinks of you as a father.

310
00:23:14,567 --> 00:23:18,276
He said to me
the other day, "I think of him..."

311
00:23:18,447 --> 00:23:20,278
As a father.

312
00:23:23,567 --> 00:23:26,286
Since he now will be marrying
Octavia...

313
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:28,802
The answer once again is yes.

314
00:23:28,967 --> 00:23:31,401
Will you let me finish?!

315
00:23:31,567 --> 00:23:34,081
You don't even know
what I'm going to say!

316
00:23:36,127 --> 00:23:40,359
You're in your cups!
You've had too much wine again.

317
00:23:41,287 --> 00:23:46,236
I thought you were going to suggest
I adopt Nero officially as my son.

318
00:23:47,007 --> 00:23:49,840
Make him and Britannicus
joint heirs.

319
00:23:50,567 --> 00:23:53,718
Of course, if that is not
what you were going to say.

320
00:23:54,367 --> 00:23:57,564
Yes. Yes, it was.

321
00:23:59,127 --> 00:24:02,563
It was. I just wish
you'd let me finish!

322
00:24:02,727 --> 00:24:04,479
Your manner's very strange.

323
00:24:04,647 --> 00:24:08,083
I just wanted to save
a lot of unnecessary discussion.

324
00:24:10,527 --> 00:24:13,837
You see, that is the success
of our marriage, my dear.

325
00:24:14,807 --> 00:24:17,321
I read your mind so quickly.

326
00:24:18,087 --> 00:24:20,647
Think of the time it saves.

327
00:24:21,647 --> 00:24:22,966
Goodnight.

328
00:24:26,527 --> 00:24:30,076
Oh, put him to bed!

329
00:24:36,887 --> 00:24:41,085
You should have consulted me!
I would have talked you out of it.

330
00:24:41,247 --> 00:24:43,715
That's why I never discussed it.

331
00:24:43,887 --> 00:24:48,119
Do you think that's right?. Am I not
your adviser on matters of state?

332
00:24:48,287 --> 00:24:51,563
- Yes.
- Then why did you not consult me?

333
00:24:51,727 --> 00:24:54,195
Do you think
that she doesn't consult Pallas?

334
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:55,800
No.

335
00:24:55,967 --> 00:24:58,037
You know they’re lovers, don't you?

336
00:24:58,207 --> 00:25:00,482
He's switched interests
from you to her?.

337
00:25:00,647 --> 00:25:02,797
- Yes.
- Then why did you do it?.

338
00:25:04,927 --> 00:25:06,918
Can't you see what you've done?

339
00:25:07,087 --> 00:25:10,204
By marrying Nero to your daughter
and adopting him,

340
00:25:10,367 --> 00:25:12,403
you've signed your death warrant.

341
00:25:13,287 --> 00:25:16,996
Your wife has got everything
she wanted out of marrying you.

342
00:25:17,167 --> 00:25:20,477
- She doesn't need you any more.
- I shall die soon anyway.

343
00:25:20,647 --> 00:25:22,797
- How do you know?.
- Barbillus told me.

344
00:25:22,967 --> 00:25:26,084
- He read my horoscope.
- You didn't need him to!

345
00:25:26,247 --> 00:25:30,081
You've numbered your days more
accurately than a horoscope could!

346
00:25:31,287 --> 00:25:35,280
Why did you do it?. Why?. Did you not
at least think of Britannicus?

347
00:25:35,447 --> 00:25:37,597
I thought principally of him.

348
00:25:37,767 --> 00:25:40,235
Then do you not see how this
will hurt him?

349
00:25:40,407 --> 00:25:42,875
Do you know how you've hurt him
in the past?.

350
00:25:43,047 --> 00:25:44,878
Yes, I know.

351
00:25:45,687 --> 00:25:48,884
You realise, don't you,
you've numbered his days as well?.

352
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:51,925
Do you think they’ll let him live?
To say nothing of me!

353
00:25:52,087 --> 00:25:53,679
What made you do it?. !

354
00:25:53,847 --> 00:25:58,079
N-Nero is destined to rule after me,
not Britannicus.

355
00:25:58,647 --> 00:26:01,878
It has been foretold, Narcissus,
nothing can alter it.

356
00:26:02,047 --> 00:26:04,720
- Foretold? By who?
- By the Sibyl

357
00:26:04,887 --> 00:26:07,879
Nero may become Emperor -
you've seen to that -

358
00:26:08,047 --> 00:26:12,518
but your wife will rule through him,
as Livia ruled through Tiberius.

359
00:26:12,687 --> 00:26:14,882
No. Nero will kill his mother.

360
00:26:15,047 --> 00:26:17,641
That, too, has been foretold
by the Sibyl

361
00:26:17,807 --> 00:26:19,798
What Sibyl?.
I've seen no such prophecy.

362
00:26:19,967 --> 00:26:23,164
No. Nor has anyone now, except me.

363
00:26:29,727 --> 00:26:31,524
Where did you find this?

364
00:26:31,687 --> 00:26:34,599
It was given to me by Livia
j-just before she died.

365
00:26:34,767 --> 00:26:38,362
She gave a birthday dinner.
She invited me. That was unusual

366
00:26:38,527 --> 00:26:41,519
But her purpose became clear
later in the avenging.

367
00:26:41,687 --> 00:26:44,884
She found this book
among Augustus' papers.

368
00:26:45,047 --> 00:26:49,086
You won't understand it.
It's written in a very archaic language.

369
00:26:50,047 --> 00:26:52,925
It frightened Augustus.
He kept it hidden.

370
00:26:53,087 --> 00:26:56,796
Or perhaps he just didn't
understand it. But Livia did.

371
00:26:57,887 --> 00:26:59,605
What does it prophesy?.

372
00:26:59,767 --> 00:27:03,760
Among other things, it prophesied
Caligula's reign and his death.

373
00:27:03,927 --> 00:27:05,918
It prophesied mine.

374
00:27:06,287 --> 00:27:08,517
And it prophesises Nero's.

375
00:27:08,687 --> 00:27:13,841
It is written, Narcissus.
Nothing you nor I can do will stop it.

376
00:27:18,047 --> 00:27:21,926
Is that why you chose
the Lady Agrippinilla for your wife?

377
00:27:22,087 --> 00:27:26,524
Yes. All my life I wanted to see
the Republic restored,

378
00:27:26,687 --> 00:27:29,042
but I let myself be made an Emperor.

379
00:27:29,207 --> 00:27:32,085
That was written too.
But I made a mistake.

380
00:27:32,247 --> 00:27:37,401
I tried to rule wisely and justly,
reconciling people to the monarchy.

381
00:27:37,567 --> 00:27:39,922
In doing that,
I was helping monarchy.

382
00:27:40,087 --> 00:27:42,601
Now I shall destroy it
once and for all

383
00:27:42,767 --> 00:27:46,806
Or rather Nero will destroy it.
He's as mad as my n-nephew, Caligula.

384
00:27:46,967 --> 00:27:49,083
We're all mad, we Caesars.

385
00:27:49,247 --> 00:27:53,160
When we are gone, the people will
finish with monarchies forever

386
00:27:53,327 --> 00:27:56,160
and return to the sanity
of the Republic.

387
00:27:56,647 --> 00:27:59,320
- And Britannicus?
- He is my instrument.

388
00:27:59,487 --> 00:28:02,957
- He will restore the Republic.
- If he lives.

389
00:28:03,127 --> 00:28:05,595
I have a plan that will save him,

390
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:09,601
but I must leave you
to make the arrangements.

391
00:28:10,367 --> 00:28:12,244
Tell me what to do.

392
00:28:12,407 --> 00:28:15,240
Well. let me rest for an hour,

393
00:28:15,407 --> 00:28:18,877
then come to my bedroom
and we'll talk some more.

394
00:28:19,687 --> 00:28:21,962
- Can I tell Britannicus?
- No, not yet.

395
00:28:22,127 --> 00:28:25,005
- It grieves me to see you hurt him.
- Yes.

396
00:28:25,167 --> 00:28:30,605
I killed his mother. I've been
less than a father to him ever since.

397
00:28:32,247 --> 00:28:35,000
Now, I'm tired and I'm not well

398
00:28:35,167 --> 00:28:37,965
- We must do it now.
- It won't be easy.

399
00:28:38,127 --> 00:28:40,436
Narcissus watches him like a hawk.

400
00:28:41,447 --> 00:28:45,326
Every morsel of food your husband
takes is tasted by someone else.

401
00:28:45,487 --> 00:28:49,366
We shall need proper advice,
but that shouldn't be hard to get.

402
00:28:49,527 --> 00:28:51,961
- Well. there is someone.
- Ah.

403
00:28:52,127 --> 00:28:55,517
A woman. Locusta.
She's very skilled.

404
00:28:56,287 --> 00:28:59,802
- I'll go and see her.
- Yes. But do it soon.

405
00:29:03,047 --> 00:29:04,958
He's very unpredictable.

406
00:29:05,127 --> 00:29:09,279
He's preferred my son to his own
at every turn. I don't understand it.

407
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:11,677
He could change his mind tomorrow.

408
00:29:11,847 --> 00:29:14,315
Yes, it's strange.
It's very strange.

409
00:29:14,487 --> 00:29:18,526
I feel he's playing some sort of game,
but I can't guess what it is.

410
00:29:18,687 --> 00:29:20,962
Neither can I, but it worries me.

411
00:29:21,127 --> 00:29:24,005
Remember that before Tiberius
struck at Sejanus

412
00:29:24,167 --> 00:29:27,045
he raised him higher
than he'd ever been before.

413
00:29:27,207 --> 00:29:29,721
There's something else
that worries me.

414
00:29:32,447 --> 00:29:34,915
How sure are you of your son?

415
00:29:37,407 --> 00:29:40,126
You may leave my son to me.

416
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:43,160
Even now that he's married?

417
00:29:44,607 --> 00:29:48,964
I know you've had a great influence
on him, but he's no longer a child.

418
00:29:49,127 --> 00:29:53,040
And when he's Emperor,
who will control him?

419
00:29:53,207 --> 00:29:55,163
(KNOCKING)

420

Come in.

422
00:30:05,767 --> 00:30:09,646
- Oh. It doesn't matter.
- No, no. I'm just going.

423

That Greek runs this Empire.

426
00:30:22,047 --> 00:30:24,800
Do you have to receive him
in your bedroom?

427
00:30:26,567 --> 00:30:28,922
- What is the matter with you?
- Nothing.

428
00:30:29,087 --> 00:30:31,282
Why aren't you in bed?
Where is Octavia?

429
00:30:31,447 --> 00:30:34,837
She's locked herself in her bedroom.
She won't let me in.

430
00:30:35,007 --> 00:30:37,760
- Did you quarrel?.
- Yes.

431
00:30:37,927 --> 00:30:41,602
- Why can't you sleep alone?
- I don't feel like it. I feel..

432
00:30:41,767 --> 00:30:43,598
Oh, I don't know!

433
00:30:43,767 --> 00:30:49,239
She won't lock me out when I'm Emperor
or tell me what to do. I shall do as I please.

434
00:30:51,287 --> 00:30:55,803
It was very naughty of Octavia
to lock you out. Very naughty.

435
00:30:56,767 --> 00:31:01,921
But she's only a child.
She doesn't understand how you feel

436
00:31:04,407 --> 00:31:07,683
Would you like me to find
a pretty house girl for you?

437
00:31:08,607 --> 00:31:11,326
Shall I find one
and send her to you?

438
00:31:12,767 --> 00:31:15,645
- Is that man your lover?.
- No, of course not.

439
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:19,846
He's no business in your bedroom.
I won't allow it when I'm Emperor.

440
00:31:29,447 --> 00:31:31,915
I won't see him here again.

441
00:31:33,847 --> 00:31:37,237
Oh, my poor baby.

442
00:31:38,367 --> 00:31:42,326
It's not fair, is it?.
Locking you out of your room.

443
00:31:43,207 --> 00:31:47,166
And you the Emperor-elect.

444
00:31:48,487 --> 00:31:51,877
But then, she's only your wife.

445
00:31:53,247 --> 00:31:56,444
She doesn't feel for you
as a mother would.

446
00:31:58,287 --> 00:32:01,359
A mother knows how her baby feels.

447
00:32:02,007 --> 00:32:03,520
Yes.

448
00:32:04,847 --> 00:32:07,645
She wouldn't let him be unhappy.

449
00:32:08,607 --> 00:32:10,006
No.

450
00:32:10,167 --> 00:32:12,442

Oh.

I'm so sleepy.

Senators, you see me here
for the last time.

456

I shall not come again.

00:33:19,767 --> 00:33:21,598
and made me Emperor.

465
00:33:22,527 --> 00:33:24,995
I n-never wanted it.

466
00:33:26,007 --> 00:33:28,123
I think it was a mistake.

467
00:33:28,287 --> 00:33:30,039
(LOUD CALLS) No! No!

468
00:33:30,207 --> 00:33:32,198
Well. be that as it may.

469
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:37,876
Soon I shall retire behind another
curtain - the final one.

470
00:33:38,047 --> 00:33:44,236
The one the gods draw over all
of us in the end, great and small

471
00:33:45,887 --> 00:33:49,038
I shan't be sorry to see
that final curtain.

472
00:33:49,207 --> 00:33:52,961
- May you live forever, Caesar!
- Oh, thank you!

473
00:33:53,127 --> 00:33:56,278
But I've no wish to,
even if I could.

474
00:33:57,527 --> 00:34:02,999
What you will s-say about me
when I'm gone...

475
00:34:03,967 --> 00:34:05,878
I can only guess at.

476
00:34:06,047 --> 00:34:10,677
I hope it won't be as cutting
as the things you've said while I was here.

477
00:34:10,847 --> 00:34:16,046
Not to my face, of course.
That's not an Emperor's privilege.

478
00:34:17,647 --> 00:34:20,320
But what is said about us
in our lives

479
00:34:20,487 --> 00:34:23,638
is not always what history says.

480
00:34:24,447 --> 00:34:28,963
And doubtless history will have
its say, as it always does.

481
00:34:30,007 --> 00:34:32,885
And about that,
I have done something.

482
00:34:33,047 --> 00:34:36,005
Not something
that need concern you...

483
00:34:37,407 --> 00:34:39,318
but something.

484
00:34:40,487 --> 00:34:46,562
You see, in the course of my life
I have known many people.

485
00:34:48,327 --> 00:34:54,880
Great people. People who have
m-made Rome what she is today.

486
00:34:56,527 --> 00:35:02,284
Yes. And one day,
they will all live again.

487
00:35:03,687 --> 00:35:06,599
The dead will come to life.

488
00:35:08,727 --> 00:35:14,085
The man who dwells by the pool
will open graves...

489
00:35:15,767 --> 00:35:18,679
and deliver Rome up again.

490
00:35:21,727 --> 00:35:26,198
She shall be seen
for what she truly was.

491
00:35:28,847 --> 00:35:32,283
(FAINT CHEERING, GROWING LOUDER)

492
00:35:37,487 --> 00:35:39,796
(SILENCE IN SENATE)

493
00:35:41,487 --> 00:35:43,796
(ROAR OF A CROWD)

494
00:36:19,807 --> 00:36:22,037
Well done, Claudius.

495
00:36:22,207 --> 00:36:26,439
Emperor after all
Who would have thought it, eh?

496
00:36:30,767 --> 00:36:33,440
You're a fool. boy, you always were.

497
00:36:34,167 --> 00:36:36,476
People say it's not your fault,

498
00:36:36,647 --> 00:36:39,639
but if it's not your fault,
whose fault is it, eh?

499
00:36:43,767 --> 00:36:48,124
And your nose is still running,
Claudius. It's still running.

500
00:36:50,127 --> 00:36:51,606
Excuse me.

501
00:36:52,927 --> 00:36:55,760
Just a minute. Just wait your turn.

502
00:37:07,047 --> 00:37:09,038
Shall a doctor be brought?.

503
00:37:10,287 --> 00:37:14,724
It wasn't worth it, was it?.
I could have told you that.

504
00:37:17,247 --> 00:37:23,197
Uncle Claudius, I wasn't the Messiah
after all Would you believe it?.

505
00:37:23,367 --> 00:37:27,246
You could have knocked me over
with a feather when they told me.

506
00:38:29,727 --> 00:38:32,924
Senators, let us continue
with the business of the day.

507
00:38:37,487 --> 00:38:39,603
Leave us, Narcissus.

508
00:38:41,767 --> 00:38:43,758
I will send for you.

509
00:38:45,687 --> 00:38:48,679
- Father, you wanted to see me.
- Yes, come here.

510
00:38:48,847 --> 00:38:52,965
My son, I've something very important
to tell you, so listen carefully.

511
00:38:53,127 --> 00:38:56,483
No one must know. That's why
I've sent for you at this hour,

512
00:38:56,647 --> 00:38:59,798
so no one in the palace
will know we've been talking.

513
00:38:59,967 --> 00:39:03,926
Now, I intend to alter my will
in favour of Nero

514
00:39:04,087 --> 00:39:06,760
and I want to explain to you
why I'm doing so.

515
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:09,839
- That's very considerate.
- Britannicus...

516
00:39:10,007 --> 00:39:14,046
Why this sudden need to explain?
You haven't felt it before.

517
00:39:14,207 --> 00:39:17,040
You adopted him,
you married him to my sister,

518
00:39:17,207 --> 00:39:21,041
you made him Consul-elect and City
Warden without one word to me.

519
00:39:21,207 --> 00:39:23,596
- You owe me nothing.
- Don't say that.

520
00:39:23,767 --> 00:39:25,598
That's nothing to what I could say!

521
00:39:25,767 --> 00:39:31,524
I may be only a child,
but I'm not blind and I'm not a stone.

522
00:39:31,967 --> 00:39:34,117
I've seen how you preferred him to me.

523
00:39:34,967 --> 00:39:36,923
It was for a reason.

524
00:39:37,087 --> 00:39:39,806
You've never loved me.

525
00:39:40,447 --> 00:39:42,802
You've never been as a father to me.
Never!

526
00:39:43,407 --> 00:39:47,400
Time without number you've shown
the world what you thought of me

527
00:39:47,567 --> 00:39:50,161
and I shall never
forgive you for it, never!

528
00:39:50,327 --> 00:39:52,283
And you killed my mother!

529
00:39:53,407 --> 00:39:57,958
I shall never forgive you
for that either. I hate you.

530
00:39:58,127 --> 00:40:00,436
Now, you listen to me.

531
00:40:02,007 --> 00:40:03,884
Yes, it's true.

532
00:40:04,047 --> 00:40:10,316
For a long time after I discovered
what your mother had been...

533
00:40:11,207 --> 00:40:13,960
how she had deceived me
every day of her life,

534
00:40:14,127 --> 00:40:16,880
I could not find it in my heart
to love you.

535
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:20,437
But you must understand,
you must be a man.

536
00:40:21,207 --> 00:40:24,597
Try to understand
a father's weaknesses.

537
00:40:27,447 --> 00:40:33,886
I don't believe you are my son.
I believe you are C-Caligula's son.

538
00:40:35,047 --> 00:40:39,643
But what difference does that make?
You do not have his nature.

539
00:40:39,807 --> 00:40:45,120
I tell you this only to explain
why I could not find it in my heart to love you.

540
00:40:45,287 --> 00:40:49,405
Was it my fault, then,
whose son I was?

541
00:40:50,447 --> 00:40:52,244
Was I to be punished?

542
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:55,676
Does a child choose his parents?

543
00:40:55,847 --> 00:40:58,725
Now, don't cry. Britannicus, please.

544
00:40:58,887 --> 00:41:00,798
- May I go now?.
- No. Come here.

545
00:41:00,967 --> 00:41:03,435
- Please may I go?
- Come here. Come here.

546
00:41:04,527 --> 00:41:06,119
Come.

547
00:41:08,687 --> 00:41:11,759
Oh, Father! Father!

548
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:15,476
I have something very important
to tell you, so listen.

549
00:41:16,447 --> 00:41:22,079
First, no matter who your father
may have been, you are now my son

550
00:41:22,247 --> 00:41:26,081
and I love you
more than anyone in the world.

551
00:41:27,167 --> 00:41:30,318
- But Nero is destined to follow me.
- Why?.

552
00:41:30,487 --> 00:41:33,285
Don't argue! It is written.
Nothing can alter it!

553
00:41:33,447 --> 00:41:37,645
When I am gone, he will try to kill you,
as C-Caligula killed Gemellus.

554
00:41:37,807 --> 00:41:40,321
That is why I have treated you
as I have.

555
00:41:40,487 --> 00:41:44,799
Kept you out of the public aye.
I have a plan to save you.

556
00:41:44,967 --> 00:41:47,845
Narcissus has arranged it all
through Caractacus.

557
00:41:48,007 --> 00:41:50,043
The world is now wholly Roman.

558
00:41:50,207 --> 00:41:54,166
There is nowhere you can be safe,
except the remotest part of Britain.

559
00:41:54,327 --> 00:41:58,161
Nero will not be able to touch you there,
for there is no one to give you up.

560
00:41:58,327 --> 00:42:01,478
Soon I shall allow
some of Caractacus' young men

561
00:42:01,647 --> 00:42:04,923
to return to northern Britain,
and you will go with them.

562
00:42:05,087 --> 00:42:07,476
You will stay
with Queen Cartimandua.

563
00:42:07,647 --> 00:42:11,196
Only she and Caractacus' son
will know your identity.

564
00:42:11,367 --> 00:42:16,521
She will send you north into regions
where no Roman's foot has ever trod,

565
00:42:16,687 --> 00:42:19,326
- and there you will wait.
- Please...

566
00:42:19,487 --> 00:42:21,796
Nero is mad.
He will destroy the Empire.

567
00:42:21,967 --> 00:42:26,836
His excesses will demand a Republic
and you will return to restore it.

568
00:42:27,607 --> 00:42:30,167
The Republic will live again.

569
00:42:33,727 --> 00:42:38,198
No. No, I won't do it.
It's not honourable.

570
00:42:38,367 --> 00:42:40,323
- Britannicus...
- No!

571
00:42:41,727 --> 00:42:45,242
Do you think that I, a Claudian,
will paint my face blue

572
00:42:45,407 --> 00:42:47,841
and go and hide among barbarians?

573
00:42:48,007 --> 00:42:51,966
- There's no shame.
- No, I won't do it!

574
00:42:52,127 --> 00:42:55,039
I'm not afraid of Nero.
Nero is a coward.

575
00:42:55,687 --> 00:42:57,962
I can protect myself.

576
00:42:58,847 --> 00:43:01,202
Let me put on my manly gown.

577
00:43:02,247 --> 00:43:06,081
Once I'm officially a man,
I'll match Nero in everything he does.

578
00:43:07,847 --> 00:43:09,838
I don't believe in the Republic.

579
00:43:10,007 --> 00:43:12,441
No one believes
in the Republic any more.

580
00:43:13,527 --> 00:43:15,597
No one does except you.

581
00:43:17,287 --> 00:43:20,916
You're old, Father,
and out of touch.

582
00:43:24,087 --> 00:43:29,241
I want my chance to rule,
and rule Rome as it should be ruled.

583
00:43:30,647 --> 00:43:34,481
If you love me, give me that chance.

584
00:43:37,327 --> 00:43:38,646
Yes.

585
00:43:40,287 --> 00:43:43,677
Yes, I should have known
that would be your answer.

586
00:43:45,447 --> 00:43:48,120
Well. so be it.

587
00:43:49,767 --> 00:43:51,598
I've done all I could.

588
00:43:53,087 --> 00:43:55,237
You shall have your wish.

589
00:43:56,527 --> 00:43:58,518
May the gods protect you.

590
00:44:02,087 --> 00:44:03,566
Britannicus.

591
00:44:05,967 --> 00:44:12,645
Perhaps you will confound
the prophecies. Yes. Perhaps you will

592
00:44:15,927 --> 00:44:19,806
Write no more, Claudius
Write no more.

593
00:44:20,767 --> 00:44:24,646
I have told it all,
as I said I would,

594
00:44:24,807 --> 00:44:27,116
and as the Sibyl prophesied.

595
00:44:27,847 --> 00:44:29,917
I have told the truth.

596
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:32,676
I have set the record straight

597
00:44:33,727 --> 00:44:36,639
it is all here
for remote posterity.

598
00:44:38,487 --> 00:44:42,196
Come, Death,
and draw the final curtain.

599
00:44:43,887 --> 00:44:45,684
I am tired.

600
00:44:46,487 --> 00:44:48,478
Oh so tired.

601
00:45:00,207 --> 00:45:02,562
So much for posterity.

602
00:45:05,007 --> 00:45:08,886
Where's the rest of it?.
It must be here. Find it!

603
00:45:15,207 --> 00:45:16,959
This looks like them.

604
00:45:17,127 --> 00:45:19,163
Yes, this is them all right.

605
00:45:19,327 --> 00:45:23,240
What a Herculean labour!

606
00:45:23,407 --> 00:45:25,841
It must have taken him years.

607
00:45:26,607 --> 00:45:29,758
Years. We'll burn the lot.

608
00:45:31,087 --> 00:45:34,682
All that work? Good grief.

609
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:37,077
We must find the will

610
00:45:50,487 --> 00:45:53,445
What a pretty thing a fire is.

611
00:45:57,247 --> 00:46:00,159
(BRITANNICUS) Did they murder him?

612
00:46:00,367 --> 00:46:04,519
(NARCISSUS) Yes.
Yes, they poisoned him.

613
00:46:06,647 --> 00:46:10,959
But how?. How did they do it?.

614
00:46:13,727 --> 00:46:16,161
Why didn't you protect him?

615
00:46:18,607 --> 00:46:21,041
Oh, they were clever, very clever.

616
00:46:22,167 --> 00:46:26,080
They tried to tamper with his food
and get at the slaves who prepared it,

617
00:46:26,247 --> 00:46:28,715
but I always stopped them. Always.

618
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:33,165
I built a wall around him
they couldn't breach.

619
00:46:36,007 --> 00:46:37,963
How, then, did she do it?.

620
00:46:38,127 --> 00:46:42,564
I will tell you.
For I see now how it was done.

621
00:46:44,607 --> 00:46:49,078
Unable to poison his food,
she must have poisoned her own.

622
00:46:49,687 --> 00:46:53,236
Yes. Poisoned hers or part of it.

623
00:46:54,287 --> 00:46:57,006
It was in a dish of mushrooms,
which he loved,

624
00:46:57,167 --> 00:46:59,362
and out of which she'd been eating.

625
00:46:59,527 --> 00:47:03,486
He'd finished his own
and was calling for some more.

626
00:47:03,647 --> 00:47:07,322
It was then that she offered him
hers out of her own dish.

627
00:47:08,727 --> 00:47:10,638
At first, I thought nothing of it.

628
00:47:10,807 --> 00:47:13,116
When you see someone
eat from a dish,

629
00:47:13,287 --> 00:47:17,121
it doesn't occur to you it may
contain something in just one part.

630
00:47:17,727 --> 00:47:21,686
And then she lifted the mushroom
onto her fork

631
00:47:21,847 --> 00:47:24,202
and held it out for him to take.

632
00:47:25,327 --> 00:47:28,763
I knew then there was something
different about it.

633
00:47:29,527 --> 00:47:32,599
I knew, as certainly as I had
ever known anything,

634
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:35,520
that he was suddenly
in the gravest danger.

635
00:47:35,687 --> 00:47:39,316
And I knew too,
as certainly as I knew that...

636
00:47:40,367 --> 00:47:44,121
that he knew - knew it was poisoned,

637
00:47:44,287 --> 00:47:47,484
knew that his end was there
on that fork...

638
00:47:48,687 --> 00:47:50,678
and that he didn't care...

639
00:47:51,567 --> 00:47:53,558
that he welcomed it.

640
00:47:58,007 --> 00:48:00,805
He died in the night, alone.

641
00:48:04,487 --> 00:48:08,366
I knocked on his door soon after
dinner, but he sent me away.

642
00:48:10,087 --> 00:48:14,558
I believe he wanted no one
to see him die.

643
00:48:28,487 --> 00:48:30,762
You must go away.
They will kill you.

644
00:48:30,927 --> 00:48:32,724
- No, I shall stay.
- Go now.

645
00:48:32,887 --> 00:48:37,881
I have put on my manly gown.
I can take care of myself.

646
00:48:39,767 --> 00:48:44,045
Poor Father. He never could.

647
00:48:48,767 --> 00:48:53,363
Oh, I don't know. He didn't do badly
when you come to think of it.

648
00:49:01,007 --> 00:49:05,285
(WOMAN'S VOICE)
Well, Old King Log?

649
00:49:06,607 --> 00:49:08,598
The poisons all hatched out?

650
00:49:09,647 --> 00:49:12,923
- Is that you, Sibyl?.
- Yes it's me.

651
00:49:14,047 --> 00:49:16,607
- Where are you?
- Here.

652
00:49:18,127 --> 00:49:20,561
(HE CHUCKLES)

653
00:49:22,247 --> 00:49:24,238
Why are you laughing?

654
00:49:25,327 --> 00:49:27,477
I cheated them again.

655
00:49:28,767 --> 00:49:31,076
They all think I'm dead.

656
00:49:31,247 --> 00:49:34,239
But you are dead, you fool!

657
00:49:34,407 --> 00:49:37,797
You're as dead as anyone can be.

658
00:49:38,207 --> 00:49:41,404
Oh, well. you can't survive
them all

659
00:49:41,567 --> 00:49:43,637
No, not even you.

660
00:49:45,167 --> 00:49:47,078
it's time to go.

661
00:49:47,247 --> 00:49:51,160
Wait. Britannicus.
What will happen to him?

662
00:49:51,327 --> 00:49:53,158
Nero will kill him.

663
00:49:53,327 --> 00:49:56,637
- And Narcissus?
- Agrippinilla will kill him.

664
00:49:56,807 --> 00:49:58,877
Then Nero will kill her.

665
00:49:59,047 --> 00:50:01,766
It all sounds depressingly familiar.

666
00:50:01,927 --> 00:50:06,796
- Yes Isn't it?
- And the Empire?

667
00:50:06,967 --> 00:50:10,642
Oh that will go on,
as Livia said it would.

668
00:50:10,807 --> 00:50:15,676
But they'll be no more Claudians
after Nero. He'll be the last.

669
00:50:15,847 --> 00:50:19,283
But the Emperors won't be a had lot
after him.

670
00:50:19,447 --> 00:50:21,881
Well, give or take a few..

671
00:50:24,407 --> 00:50:28,400
Quite a story, wasn't it?

672
00:50:30,327 --> 00:50:34,605
All of it

673
00:50:38,007 --> 00:50:40,202
(THEY CHUCKLE)

674
00:50:41,287 --> 00:50:46,042
Lucky for you
you made a copy and buried it.

675
00:50:49,207 --> 00:50:53,485
it's time to go, Claudius
The ferryman is waiting.

676
00:50:53,647 --> 00:50:56,559
- Just one thing more.
- You can't put it off..

677
00:50:56,727 --> 00:50:59,560
You can't stay here forever..

678
00:51:00,447 --> 00:51:02,915
No, I suppose not.

679
00:51:03,567 --> 00:51:04,966
Now...

680
00:51:07,207 --> 00:51:09,243
Close your eyes

681
00:51:13,007 --> 00:51:19,116
it's but a short step to the boat,
a short pull across the river..

682
00:51:20,087 --> 00:51:21,918
And then?

683
00:51:22,087 --> 00:51:29,846
And then, I promise you, you'll
dream a different story altogether..

684
00:51:34,447 --> 00:51:40,124
Farewell, Tiberius Claudius Drusus
Nero Germanicus

685
00:51:41,007 --> 00:51:46,206
God of the Britons,
one-time Emperor of the Roman world.

686
00:51:47,247 --> 00:51:49,124
Farewell.
